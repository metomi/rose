        Rose: a framework for managing and running meteorological suites.
        
        ### Python 2 or Python 3 ?
        
        Currently in the source code repository:
         - **master branch:** Python 3, **no GUI** - **Rose-2/Cylc-8 Work In Progress**
         - **2019.01.x branch:** Python 2, PyGTK GUI - **Rose-1/Cylc-7 Maintenance**
        
        The first official Rose-2/Cylc-8 release (with a new web UI) is not expected
        until late 2019. Until then we recommend the latest rose-2019.01.x/cylc-7.8.x
        release for production use.
