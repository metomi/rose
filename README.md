Rose: a framework for managing and running meteorological suites.

### Python 2 or Python 3 ?

Currently in the source code repository:
 - **master branch:** Python 3, **no GUI** - **Rose-2/Cylc-8 Work In Progress**
 - **2019.01.x branch:** Python 2, PyGTK GUI - **Rose-1/Cylc-7 Maintenance**

The first official Rose-2/Cylc-8 release (with a new web UI) is not expected
until late 2019. Until then we recommend the latest rose-2019.01.x/cylc-7.8.x
release for production use.
