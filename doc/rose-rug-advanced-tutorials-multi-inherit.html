      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This part of the Rose user guide walks you through using more than one
      cylc family for configuring a task's runtime (multiple inheritance).</p>

      <p>This helps when tasks naturally belong to more than one category -
      e.g. an application type category and a job submission type category.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

      <p>Our example suite will control a drag race.</p><img class="r-floater"
      src=
      "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Pro_Street_Camaro_at_launch.JPG"
      width="70%" alt="Drag race starting in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan" />

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a blank
      <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks
      like <a href=
      "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-multi-inherit/suite.rc.html">this</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Setup (2)</h3>

      <p>Create a subdirectory in your suite directory called <samp>lib/</samp>
      and create a file inside this subdirectory called
      <samp>output.html</samp> with <a href=
      "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-multi-inherit/output.html">this
      content</a>. This is a web page that summarises the suite output.</p>

      <p>We also need to copy the library <a href=
      "jquery.min.js">jquery.min.js</a> into the same directory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Setup (3)</h3>

      <p>We'll also need an executable script that looks like <a href=
      "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-multi-inherit/race.html">this</a> -
      create a <samp>bin/</samp> subdirectory in your suite directory, and
      paste the script into a file called <samp>race</samp>. The
      <samp>bin/</samp> directory is added to the path by <code>cylc</code>,
      which means you can just specify the command in <code>script</code> (e.g.
      <samp>script = race</samp>).</p>

      <p>We need to make the file executable as well - you'll need to run:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
chmod +x bin/race
</pre>

      <p>where your current working directory is the suite directory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

      <p>A realistic scenario for multiple inheritance might be when you have
      one set of families handling job submission (e.g. parallel vs serial) and
      one set driving the particular setup of the code run by the task (e.g.
      for different systems).</p>

      <p>In our <samp>suite.rc</samp> file, there is a set of families for the
      engine (<samp>ENGINE_PETROL</samp>, <samp>ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp>), and
      one for the actual chassis and body (<samp>BODY_CAR</samp>,
      <samp>BODY_TRUCK</samp>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Explanation (2)</h3>

      <p>We need to use configuration from both sets to build a racer.</p>

      <p>We can see from the <samp>graph</samp> specification in
      <samp>dependencies</samp> that we have a family called
      <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp> whose tasks will be run.</p>

      <p><samp>BODY_CAR</samp> and <samp>BODY_TRUCK</samp> themselves inherit
      from <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp>, so any tasks belonging to these
      families will also belong to <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp> and will be
      run.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="single">Single Inheritance</h3>

      <p>Let's start off with creating a configuration for a task called
      <samp>red_car</samp>.</p>

      <p>We'll inherit from a single family <samp>BODY_CAR</samp> - put this
      under the <samp>[runtime]</samp> section:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        inherit = BODY_CAR
</pre>

      <p>Since <samp>BODY_CAR</samp> inherits from
      <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp>, and every task/family inherits from
      <samp>root</samp>, the order configuration is applied and overwritten in
      is:</p>
      <pre>
settings in root
extended/overwritten by settings in COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
extended/overwritten by settings in BODY_CAR
extended/overwritten by settings in red_car
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Diagram</h3>

      <p>In a diagram form, the inheritance looks like:</p>
      <pre>
      root
        |
  COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
        |
     BODY_CAR
        |
     red_car
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="multi">Multiple Inheritance</h3>

      <p>This means that any settings in, for example, <samp>root</samp>, can
      be overwritten by settings from the others. This is the standard way that
      single inheritance of families works.</p>

      <p>We now need an engine - this means that we need to include some
      configuration from an entirely separate family.</p>

      <p>Add another family to inherit from by writing:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        inherit = BODY_CAR, ENGINE_ELECTRIC
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="precedence">Multiple Inheritance Precedence</h3>

      <p>In a diagram form, the inheritance now looks like:</p>
      <pre>
       root
      /   \__________
     /               \
COMPETITOR_VEHICLE  ENGINE_ELECTRIC
     /          _____/
  BODY_CAR     /
      \       /
        red_car
</pre>

      <p>The order of inheritance becomes:</p>
      <pre>
settings in root
extended/overwritten by settings in ENGINE_ELECTRIC
extended/overwritten by settings in COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
extended/overwritten by BODY_CAR
extended/overwritten by red_car
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Multiple Inheritance Precedence (2)</h3>

      <p>We can see that settings in <samp>ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp> could be
      overwritten by the other families and the task itself - in other words,
      the inheritance list in <samp>inherit = BODY_CAR, ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp>
      is basically last-to-first (<samp>ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp> then the
      <samp>BODY_CAR</samp>-related families (<samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp>
      and <samp>BODY_CAR</samp>)).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Task Configuration</h3>

      <p>We also need some racing colours, which should be task-specific -
      change the runtime to:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        inherit = BODY_CAR, ENGINE_ELECTRIC
        [[[environment]]]
            COMP_COLOUR = red
</pre>

      <p>When <code>cylc</code> evaluates this runtime now, it will be
      equivalent to:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        # From COMPETITOR_VEHICLE:
        script = race

        [[[environment]]]
            # From ENGINE ELECTRIC:
            COMP_GEAR_RATIOS = 2.0
            COMP_POWER_FRAC_VS_1000_RPM = 0.63 0.65 0.66 0.69 0.71 0.73 0.76 0.78 0.81 0.84 0.88 0.92 0.96 1.0 0.8 0.5
            COMP_MAX_POWER_KW = 126

            # From BODY_CAR:
            COMP_MASS_KG = 1000
            COMP_WHEEL_DIAMETER_M = 0.5

            # From red_car itself:
            COMP_COLOUR = red
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Task Configuration Overrides</h3>

      <p>Note that because configuration in the task is applied last, you can
      override any family configuration at the task level - whether single
      inheritance or multiple.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="another">Another Contender</h3>

      <p>A race isn't a race without more than one competitor - add another
      <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp> task in the runtime:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[blue_truck]]
        inherit = BODY_TRUCK, ENGINE_PETROL
        [[[environment]]]
            COMP_COLOUR = blue
</pre>

      <p>This task inherits from different families, but gives a similar kind
      of configuration to <samp>red_car</samp>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="run">Running the Suite</h3>

      <p>Go ahead and run the suite with <code>rose suite-run</code>. The two
      vehicles will race over a quarter mile, and you should see the results in
      the <code>cylc gui</code>. The environment variables we set up will be
      printed in the standard output of both tasks. You can view the output with
      Rose Bush by following the link to the <samp>job.out</samp> file of the
      <samp>output</samp> task.</p>

      <p>This is a successful implementation of multiple inheritance! The next
      thing to do is to make it slightly more tricky.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="more-complex-inheritance">More Complex Inheritance</h3>

      <p>Let's suppose the race organisers decide on a maximum engine power for
      competitors to adhere to. At the moment, <samp>COMP_MAX_POWER_KW</samp>
      is different in the two types of engine we've specified.</p>

      <p>As this will be common to all competitors, it makes sense to move the
      setting to the <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp> class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Implementing Diamond Inheritance</h3>

      <p>Remove all the lines in the <samp>suite.rc</samp> file for
      <samp>COMP_MAX_POWER_KW</samp>, and change the
      <samp>COMPETITOR_VEHICLE</samp> runtime to:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[COMPETITOR_VEHICLE]]
        pre-script = printenv | sort | grep ^COMP
        script = race
        [[[environment]]]
            COMP_MAX_POWER_KW = 130
            COMP_OUTPUT_DIR = $CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH
</pre>

      <p>We'll also change the ENGINE families so that they include this
      setting through inheritance - add <samp>inherit</samp> lines to both
      ENGINE families:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Implementing Diamond Inheritance (2)</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[ENGINE_PETROL]]
        inherit = COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
</pre>

      <p>and</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[ENGINE_ELECTRIC]]
        inherit = COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Implementing Diamond Inheritance (3)</h3>

      <p>Our <samp>red_car</samp> task has <samp>inherit = BODY_CAR,
      ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp>.</p>

      <p>The inheritance order for the <samp>red_car</samp> task used to
      be:</p>
      <pre>
settings in root
extended/overwritten by settings in ENGINE_ELECTRIC
extended/overwritten by settings in COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
extended/overwritten by BODY_CAR
extended/overwritten by red_car
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Implementing Diamond Inheritance (4)</h3>

      <p>However, since the ENGINE families now inherit from
      COMPETITOR_VEHICLE, they should be evaluated after it - they should be
      able to override that family. The algorithm will recognise this and
      change the order accordingly.</p>

      <p>This means that the order will now be:</p>
      <pre>
settings in root
extended/overwritten by settings in COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
extended/overwritten by settings in ENGINE_ELECTRIC
extended/overwritten by BODY_CAR
extended/overwritten by red_car
</pre>

      <p>which is subtly different. This is a case of <a href=
      "http://mypythonnotes.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/python-multiple-inheritance-and-the-diamond-problem/">
      diamond inheritance</a>, where the diagram goes:</p>
      <pre>
        root
          |
  COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
     /         \
  BODY_CAR   ENGINE_ELECTRIC
      \       /
        red_car
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="diamond-override">Overriding Multiple Inheritance</h3>

      <p>Although this is more complex, it's still easy to override
      settings.</p>

      <p>Let's suppose there's some cheating going on, and the standard
      <samp>ENGINE_PETROL</samp> family actually has a bit more power. Change
      the <samp>ENGINE_PETROL</samp> family to override the
      <samp>COMP_MAX_POWER_KW</samp> setting:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[ENGINE_PETROL]]
        inherit = COMPETITOR_VEHICLE
        [[[environment]]]
            COMP_GEAR_RATIOS = 3.18 2.26 1.68 1.29 1.06
            COMP_POWER_FRAC_VS_1000_RPM = 0.18 0.3 0.6 0.88 1.0 0.6
            COMP_MAX_POWER_KW = 200  # Cheating!
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Overriding Diamond Inheritance (2)</h3>

      <p>Meanwhile, our <samp>red_car</samp> task has invested in some oversize
      wheels - change the <samp>red_car</samp> runtime to read:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        inherit = BODY_CAR, ENGINE_ELECTRIC
        [[[environment]]]
            COMP_COLOUR = red
            COMP_WHEEL_DIAMETER_M = 1.0  # Override the standard BODY_CAR setting
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="re-run">Re-Running the suite</h3>

      <p>Run the suite again, and have a look at the output files - the
      overrides or overwriting of settings should have happened.
      <samp>COMP_WHEEL_DIAMETER_M</samp> should now be <samp>1.0</samp> for the
      <samp>red_car</samp> task, and the <samp>COMP_MAX_POWER_KW</samp> should
      be <samp>200</samp> in the <samp>blue_truck</samp> task.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="more-work">Further work</h2>

      <p>If you like, have a go at overriding various settings in the tasks and
      families, and seeing at which points this becomes effective.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

      <p>You can inherit from any number of families, not just two - for
      example, you could invent a scenario where you might write:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[red_car]]
        inherit = BODY_CAR, ENGINE_ELECTRIC, SPOILER_OUTSIZE
</pre>

      <p>The inheritance order will still be evaluated last-to-first, so both
      <samp>BODY_CAR</samp> and <samp>ENGINE_ELECTRIC</samp> (and any families
      they inherit from) can override <samp>SPOILER_OUTSIZE</samp>. The
      <samp>red_car</samp> task itself can override any inheritance.</p>
