    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tutorial walks you through using family triggers.</p>

      <p>Family triggers allow you to build dependencies based on sets of
      tasks sharing the same namespace, sometimes referred to as
      "families".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

      <p>Family triggers are used to specify a condition to be met by a set
      of tasks in a particular family that will trigger the next entry in
      the dependencies graph.</p>

      <p>Like regular task based triggers, family triggers can depend on the
      success or failure of tasks. However, because a family can contain
      multiple tasks, you need to specify whether you are concerned with
      <em>all</em> or <em>any</em> of the tasks in that family reaching the
      desired state.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-task">Example</h2>

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a blank
      <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks
      like this:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example suite.rc</h3>

      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[cylc]
    UTC mode = True # Ignore DST
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = visit_mine =&gt; MINERS
[runtime]
    [[visit_mine]]
        script = sleep 5; echo 'off to work we go'
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example (2)</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[MINERS]]
        script = """
sleep 5;
if (($RANDOM % 2)); then
    echo 'Diamonds!'; true;
else
    echo 'Nothing...'; false;
fi
"""
    [[doc, grumpy, sleepy, happy, bashful, sneezy, dopey]]
        inherit = MINERS
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>

      <p>You have now created a suite that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>contains a <samp>visit_mine</samp> task that sleeps for 5 seconds
        then outputs a message.</li>

        <li>contains a <samp>MINERS</samp> family with a command in
        it that randomly succeeds or fails.</li>

        <li>contains 7 tasks that inherit from <samp>MINERS</samp>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Run the suite</h3>

      <p>Save your changes and run the suite using <samp>rose suite-run</samp>.
      The <code>cylc gui</code> should launch and you should see the
      <samp>visit_mine</samp> task run, then trigger the members of the
      <samp>MINERS</samp> family.  Note that some of the <samp>MINERS</samp>
      tasks may fail so you should stop your suite using the stop button in the
      <code>cylc gui</code> in order to allow it to shutdown.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-trigger">Family triggering: success</h2>

      <p>As you will have noticed by watching the suite run, some of the tasks
      in the <samp>MINERS</samp> family succeed and some fail.</p>

      <p>We would like to add a task to sell any diamonds we find, but wait for
      all the miners to report back first so we only make the one trip.</p>

      <p>We can address this by using <em>family triggers</em>. In particular,
      we are going to use the <samp>finish-all</samp> trigger to check for all
      members of the <samp>MINERS</samp> family finishing, and the
      <samp>succeed-any</samp> trigger to check for any of the tasks in the
      <samp>MINERS</samp> family succeeding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Family triggering: success (2)</h3>

      <p>Open your <samp>suite.rc</samp> file and change the
      <samp>[[dependencies]]</samp> to look like this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """visit_mine =&gt; MINERS
                   MINERS:finish-all &amp; MINERS:succeed-any =&gt; sell_diamonds"""
</pre>

      <p>Then, add the following task to the <samp>[runtime]</samp>
      section:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[sell_diamonds]]
        script = sleep 5
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Family triggering: success (3)</h3>

      <p>These changes add a <samp>sell_diamonds</samp> task to the suite which
      is run once <em>all</em> the <samp>MINERS</samp> tasks have finished and
      if <em>any</em> of them have succeeded.</p>

      <p>Save your changes and run your suite. You should see the new
      <samp>sell_diamonds</samp> task being run once all the miners have
      finished and at least one of them has succeeded. As before, stop your
      suite using the stop button in the <code>cylc gui</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="rose-host-select">Family triggering: failure</h2>

      <p>Cylc also allows us to trigger off failure of tasks in a particular
      family.</p>

      <p>We would like to add another task to close down unproductive
      mineshafts once all the miners have reported back and had time to discuss
      their findings.</p>

      <p>To do this we will make use of family triggers in a similar manner
      to before.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Family triggering: failure (2)</h3>

      <p>Open your <samp>suite.rc</samp> file and change the
      <samp>[[dependencies]]</samp> to look like this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """visit_mine =&gt; MINERS
                   MINERS:finish-all &amp; MINERS:succeed-any =&gt; sell_diamonds
                   MINERS:finish-all &amp; MINERS:fail-any =&gt; close_shafts
                   close_shafts =&gt; !MINERS
                   """
</pre>

      <p>and alter the <samp>[[sell_diamonds]]</samp> section to look like
      this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
    [[close_shafts, sell_diamonds]]
        script = sleep 5
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Family triggering: failure (3)</h3>

      <p>These changes add a <samp>close_shafts</samp> task which is run once
      all the <samp>MINERS</samp> tasks have finished and any of them have
      failed. On completion it applies a
      <a href="rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-suicide.html">suicide trigger</a> to
      the <samp>MINERS</samp> family in order to allow the suite to
      shutdown.</p>

      <p>Save your changes and run your suite. You should see the new
      <samp>close_shafts</samp> run should any of the <samp>MINERS</samp> tasks
      be in the failed state once they have all finished.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="reference">Different triggers</h2>

      <p>Other types of triggers beyond those covered in the example are also
      available.</p>

      <p>The following types of "all" type triggers are available:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><samp>FAM:start-all</samp> - all the tasks in FAM have started</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:succeed-all</samp> - all the tasks in FAM have
        succeeded</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:fail-all</samp> - all the tasks in FAM have failed</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:finish-all</samp> - all the tasks in FAM have
        finished</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Different triggers (2)</h3>

      <p>The following types of "any" type triggers are available:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><samp>FAM:start-any</samp> - at least one task in FAM has
        started</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:succeed-any</samp> - at least one task in FAM has
        succeeded</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:fail-any</samp> - at least one task in FAM has
        failed</li>

        <li><samp>FAM:finish-any</samp> - at least one task in FAM has
        finished</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Family triggers allow you to create dependencies on particular
        families.</li>

        <li>Like task triggers, family triggers can be based on success,
        failure, starting and finishing of tasks in a family.</li>

        <li>Family triggers can trigger off either <em>all</em> or
        <em>any</em> of the tasks in a family.</li>
      </ul>
