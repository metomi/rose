    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tutorial walks you through using suicide triggers.</p>

      <p>Suicide triggers allow you to remove tasks from the suite during
      runtime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

      <p>Suicide triggers can be used to remove any task from a suite while it
      is running.</p>

      <p>They work much like any other type of trigger in a suite, except that
      rather than running a particular task once the triggering condition is
      met, the task is instead removed from the suite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-task">Example</h2>

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a blank
      <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks
      like this:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example suite.rc</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[cylc]
    UTC mode = True # Ignore DST
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
            bake_cake:fail =&gt; purchase_cake
            bake_cake | purchase_cake =&gt; eat_cake
            """
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Description</h3>

      <p>This sets up a simple suite which consists of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a <samp>bake_cake</samp> task which either succeeds or fails</li>

        <li>a <samp>purchase_cake</samp> "recovery" task which is run if
        <samp>bake_cake</samp> fails</li>

        <li>an <samp>eat_cake</samp> task which runs once cake has been
        obtained i.e. once <samp>bake_cake</samp> or <samp>purchase_cake</samp>
        has succeeded</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For purposes of this tutorial <samp>purchase_cake</samp> will always
      succeed as cake should be available to buy somewhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Runtime</h3>

      <p>It will need some runtime. Add the following to your
      <samp>suite.rc</samp> file:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[runtime]
    [[bake_cake]]
        script = """
sleep 10;
if (($RANDOM % 2)); then
    echo 'Success'; true;
else
    echo 'Burned the cake!'; false;
fi
"""
    [[purchase_cake]]
        script = sleep 10; echo 'Off to the shops!'
    [[eat_cake]]
        script = sleep 10; echo 'Mmm cake!'
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Run the suite</h3>

      <p>Save your changes and run the suite using <samp>rose
      suite-run</samp></p>

      <p>The suite should now run. If <samp>bake_cake</samp> fails,
      <samp>purchase_cake</samp> is triggered which triggers
      <samp>eat_cake</samp>. Otherwise, <samp>bake_cake</samp> triggers
      <samp>eat_cake</samp>.</p>

      <p>Notice that at once <samp>eat_cake</samp> has completed the suite does
      not shut down. This is because either <samp>bake_cake</samp> is in the
      failed state or <samp>purchase_cake</samp> is waiting to be triggered.
      Shut down the suite by pressing the stop button in the <code>cylc
      gui</code>.</p>

      <p>You may want to run the suite again to see both situations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-trigger">Adding suicide triggers</h2>

      <p>Since <samp>purchase_cake</samp> has corrected for the failure of
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> we don't need the suite to keep running - we would
      like the suite to be able to shutdown once the final cycle has
      completed.</p>

      <p>We can make use of a suicide trigger to remove the failed
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> task.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (2)</h3>

      <p>Once <samp>purchase_cake</samp> has succeeded we no longer need
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> so we can use a suicide trigger to remove
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> from the suite.</p>

      <p>Modify the <samp>[scheduling]</samp> section to look like the
      following:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
            bake_cake:fail =&gt; purchase_cake
            bake_cake | purchase_cake =&gt; eat_cake
            purchase_cake =&gt; !bake_cake
            """
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (3)</h3>

      <p>The line <samp>purchase_cake =&gt; !bake_cake</samp> is the suicide
      trigger. When <samp>purchase_cake</samp> succeeds, <samp>bake_cake</samp>
      is removed from the suite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (4)</h3>

      <p>We also need to remove the <samp>purchase_cake</samp> from the suite
      if it is not needed i.e. when <samp>bake_cake</samp> succeeds.</p>

      <p>Add the line <samp>bake_cake =&gt; !purchase_cake</samp> to the
      dependencies graph.</p>

      <p>Save your changes and run your suite. You should now be able to
      <samp>eat_cake</samp> and not worry about previous tasks keeping the
      suite from shutting down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="notes">Note on suicide triggers</h2>

      <p>While it is possible to have a task suicide triggering itself this is
      not recommended and may lead to difficulties if manual interaction with
      the suite is required to correct the problem (the task has been removed
      from the suite).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Note on suicide triggers (2)</h3>

      <p>Depending on your needs, possible places to put the suicide trigger
      are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>triggering off the success of a recovery task</li>

        <li>triggering off the final task in a cycle</li>

        <li>triggering off a cleanup task in the suite</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
          <h2 id="advanced-example">Advanced suicide triggers example</h2>

    <div class="slide">
        <h3 id="example-task2">Advanced Example 1</h3>

      <p>The first example checks the failure of an unreliable task, if it 
      meets the criteria in the checking task then it tries a recovery task.
      If the recovery task succeeds then the suite carries on, else if it fails 
      then the suite stops as it cannot be recovered.</p>

      <p>Possible Outcomes:</p>
      <p>If <samp>flaky_activity</samp> fails then run <samp>check</samp>, the
      <samp>check</samp> checks to see if the suite is recoverable, if it is
      then <samp>recovery</samp> succeeds and the suite can continue. 
      If it is not recoverable, i.e., <samp>check</samp> fails then don't run 
      housekeep as the suite cannnot carry on and needs human interaction to 
      fix.</p>

      <p>If <samp>flaky_activity</samp> succeeds the suite carries on as 
      normal, i.e., going straight to <samp>housekeep</samp> and not running 
      either of the <samp>check</samp> or <samp>recovery</samp> tasks.</p>

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a
      <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks like this:</p>
