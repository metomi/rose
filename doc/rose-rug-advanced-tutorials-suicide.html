      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This tutorial walks you through using suicide triggers.</p>

      <p>Suicide triggers allow you to remove tasks from the suite during 
      runtime.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

      <p>Suicide triggers can be used to remove any task from a suite while it
      is running.</p>
      
      <p>They work much like any other type of trigger in a suite, except that 
      rather than running a particular task once the triggering condition is 
      met, the task is instead removed from the suite.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-task">Example</h2>

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a blank
      <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks
      like this:</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example suite.rc</h3>

      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[cylc]
    UTC mode = True # Ignore DST
    [[event hooks]]
        timeout handler = "rose suite-hook --mail --shutdown"
        timeout = 4320 # 3 days
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
            bake_cake:fail =&gt; buy_cake
            bake_cake | buy_cake =&gt; eat_cake
            """
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Description</h3>

      <p>This sets up a simple suite which consists of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <samp>bake_cake</samp> task which either succeeds or fails</li>
        <li>a <samp>buy_cake</samp> "recovery" task which is run if 
        <samp>bake_cake</samp> fails</li>  
        <li>an <samp>eat_cake</samp> task which runs once cake has been 
        obtained i.e. once <samp>bake_cake</samp> or <samp>buy_cake</samp> has 
        succeeded</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For purposes of this tutorial <samp>buy_cake</samp> will always 
      succeed as cake should be available to buy somewhere.</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Runtime</h3>

      <p>It will need some runtime. Add the following to your 
      <samp>suite.rc</samp> file:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[event hooks]]]
            succeeded handler = "rose suite-hook"
            failed handler = "rose suite-hook"
    [[bake_cake]]
        command scripting = """ sleep 10; 
                                if (($RANDOM % 2)); then 
                                    echo 'Success'; true;
                                else 
                                    echo 'Burned the cake!'; false;
                                fi
                            """
    [[buy_cake]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo 'Off to the shops!'"
    [[eat_cake]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo 'Mmm cake!'"
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Run the suite</h3>
      <p>Save your changes and run the suite using <samp>rose suite-run</samp>
      </p>
      
      <p>The suite should now run. If <samp>bake_cake</samp> fails, 
      <samp>buy_cake</samp> is triggered which triggers <samp>eat_cake</samp>.
      Otherwise, <samp>bake_cake</samp> triggers <samp>eat_cake</samp>.</p>

      <p>Notice that at once  <samp>eat_cake</samp> has completed the suite 
      does not shut down. This is because either <samp>bake_cake</samp> is in 
      the failed state or <samp>buy_cake</samp> is waiting to be triggered. 
      Shut down the suite by pressing the stop button in the cylc gui.</p>
    
      <p>You may want to run the suite again to see both situations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-trigger">Adding suicide triggers</h2>
      <p>Since <samp>buy_cake</samp> has corrected for the failure of 
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> we don't need the suite to keep 
      running - we would like the suite to be able to shutdown once the final 
      cycle has completed.</p>
      
      <p>We can make use of a suicide trigger to remove the failed 
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> task.</p> 

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (2)</h3>

      <p>Once <samp>buy_cake</samp> has succeeded we no longer need 
      <samp>bake_cake</samp> so we can use a suicide 
      trigger to remove <samp>bake_cake</samp> from the suite.</p>
      
      <p>Modify the <samp>[scheduling]</samp> section to look like the following:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
            bake_cake:fail =&gt; buy_cake
            bake_cake | buy_cake =&gt; eat_cake
            buy_cake =&gt; !bake_cake
            """
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (3)</h3>
      
      <p>The line <samp>buy_cake =&gt; !bake_cake</samp> is the suicide 
      trigger. When <samp>buy_cake</samp> succeeds, <samp>bake_cake</samp> is 
      removed from the suite.</p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding suicide triggers (4)</h3>
      
      <p>We also need to remove the <samp>buy_cake</samp> from the suite if
      it is not needed i.e. when <samp>bake_cake</samp> succeeds.</p>
      
      <p>Add the line <samp>bake_cake =&gt; !buy_cake</samp> to the 
      dependencies graph.</p>
      
      <p>Save your changes and run your suite. You should now be able to 
      <samp>eat_cake</samp> and not worry about previous tasks keeping the 
      suite from shutting down.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="notes">Note on suicide triggers</h2> 
    
      <p>While it is possible to have a task suicide triggering itself this is 
      not recommended and may lead to difficulties if manual interaction with 
      the suite is required to correct the problem (the task has been removed 
      from the suite).</p> 
      
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Note on suicide triggers (2)</h3> 
          
      <p>Depending on your needs, possible places to put the suicide trigger 
      are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>triggering off the success of a recovery task</li>
        <li>triggering off the final task in a cycle</li>
        <li>triggering off a cleanup task in the suite</li>
      </ul>    
    </div>
    
  </div>
