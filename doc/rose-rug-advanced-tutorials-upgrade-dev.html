    </div>

    <div class="handout" id="content"></div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This part of the Rose user guide walks you through writing macros to
      upgrade application configurations to newer metadata versions.</p>

      <p>Upgrade macros are intended to keep application configurations in sync
      with changes to application inputs e.g. from new code releases.</p>

      <p>You should already be familiar with using <a href=
      "rose-command.html#rose-app-upgrade">rose app-upgrade</a> (see the
      <a href="rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-upgrade-usage.html">Upgrade
      Usage</a> tutorial) and the concepts in the <a href=
      "rose-configuration-metadata.html#appendix-upgrade">reference</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

      <p>In this example, we'll be upgrading a boat on a desert
      island.</p><img class="r-floater" src=
      "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Proa1.jpg" width=
      "30%" alt="Micronesia proa (sailing multihull)" />

      <p>Create a new directory called <samp>make-boat-app</samp> somewhere -
      e.g. in your homespace - containing a <samp>rose-app.conf</samp> file
      with the following content:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
meta=make-boat/0.1

[namelist:materials]
hollow_tree_trunks=1
paddling_twigs=1
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App Explanation</h3>

      <p>This creates an app config that configures our simple boat (a dugout
      canoe). It references a meta-flag (for which metadata is unlikely to
      already exist), made up of a category (<samp>make-boat</samp>) at a
      particular version (<samp>0.1</samp>). The meta flag is used by Rose to
      locate a configuration metadata directory.</p>

      <p>Make sure you're using <samp>make-boat</samp> and not
      <samp>make_boat</samp> - the hyphen makes all the difference!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App Version Explanation</h3>

      <p>It's important to note that the version in the meta flag doesn't have
      to be numeric - it could be <samp>vn0.1</samp> or <samp>alpha</samp> or
      <samp>Crafty-Canoe</samp>.</p>

      <p>We need to create some metadata to make this work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-metadata">Example Metadata</h2>

      <p>We need a <samp>rose-meta/</samp> directory somewhere, to store our
      metadata - for the purposes of this tutorial it's easiest to put in in
      your homespace, but the location does not matter.</p>

      <p>Create a <samp>rose-meta/make-boat/</samp> directory in your
      homespace:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
mkdir -p ~/rose-meta/make-boat/
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example Metadata Explanation</h3>

      <p>This is the category (also called command) directory for the metadata,
      which will hold sub-directories for actual configuration metadata
      versions (each containing a <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file, etc).</p>

      <p>N.B. Configuration metadata would normally be managed by whoever
      manages Rose installation at your site.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Creating Example Metadata Versions</h3>

      <p>We know we need some metadata for the <samp>0.1</samp> version, so
      create a <samp>0.1/</samp> subdirectory under
      <samp>rose-meta/make-boat/</samp>:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
mkdir -p ~/rose-meta/make-boat/0.1/
</pre>

      <p>We'll need a <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file there too, so create an
      empty one in the new directory:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
touch ~/rose-meta/make-boat/0.1/rose-meta.conf
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Creating the First Metadata Version</h3>

      <p>We can safely say that our two namelist inputs are essential for the
      construction and testing of the boat, so we can paste the following into
      the newly created <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[namelist:materials=hollow_tree_trunks]
compulsory=true
values=1

[namelist:materials=paddling_twigs]
compulsory=true
range=1:
type=integer
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">So Far</h3>

      <p>So far, we have a normal application configuration which references
      some metadata, somewhere, for a category at a certain version.</p>

      <p>Let's make another version to upgrade to.</p>

      <p>The next version of our boat will have <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger_canoe">outriggers</a> to make it
      more stable. Some of the inputs in our application configuration will
      need to change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Creating the Next Metadata Version</h3>

      <p>Our application configuration might need to look something like this,
      after any upgrade (don't change it yet!):</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
meta=make-boat/0.2

[namelist:materials]
misc_branches=4
hollow_tree_trunks=1
outrigger_tree_trunks=2
paddling_branches=1
</pre>

      <p>It looks like we've added the inputs <samp>misc_branches</samp>,
      <samp>outrigger_tree_trunks</samp> and <samp>paddling_branches</samp>.
      <samp>paddling_twigs</samp> is no longer there (now redundant), so we can
      remove it from the configuration when we upgrade.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Metadata for the Next Metadata Version</h3>

      <p>Let's create the new metadata version, to document what we need and
      don't need.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Metadata Snippet</h3>

      <p>Create a new subdirectory, <samp>0.2/</samp> under
      <samp>make-boat/</samp>, containing a <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file
      that looks like this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[namelist:materials=hollow_tree_trunks]
compulsory=true
values=1

[namelist:materials=misc_branches]
compulsory=true
range=4:

[namelist:materials=paddling_branches]
compulsory=true
range=1:
type=integer

[namelist:materials=outrigger_tree_trunks]
compulsory=true
values=2
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Summary</h3>

      <p>You can check that everything is OK so far by changing directory to
      the <samp>make-boat/</samp> directory and running <code>find</code> - it
      should look something like:</p>
      <pre>
.
./0.1
./0.1/rose-meta.conf
./0.2
./0.2/rose-meta.conf
</pre>

      <p>We now want to automate the process of updating our app config from
      <samp>make-boat/0.1</samp> to the new <samp>make-boat/0.2</samp>
      version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="versions.py">versions.py</h2>

      <p>Upgrade macros are invoked through a Python module,
      <samp>versions.py</samp>, that doesn't live with any particular version
      metadata - it should be present at the root of the category
      directory.</p>

      <p>Create a new file <samp>versions.py</samp> under
      <samp>make-boat/</samp> (<samp>~/rose-meta/make-boat/versions.py</samp>).
      We'll add a macro to it in a little bit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Upgrade Macros Explained</h3>

      <p>Upgrade macros are Python objects with a <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> (e.g.
      <samp>"0.1"</samp>) and an <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp> (e.g.
      <samp>"0.2"</samp>). The <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> is the 'start' version
      (if upgrading) and the <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp> is the 'destination'
      version.</p>

      <p>When a user requests an upgrade for their configuration (e.g. by
      running <code>rose app-upgrade</code>), the <samp>versions.py</samp> file
      will be searched for a macro whose <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> matches the
      <samp>meta=...</samp> version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Upgrade Version Changes</h3>

      <p>For example, for our <samp>meta=make-boat/0.1</samp> flag, we'd need a
      macro whose <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> was <samp>"0.1"</samp>.</p>

      <p>When a particular upgrade macro is run, the version in the app
      configuration will be changed from <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> to
      <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp> (e.g. <samp>meta=make-boat/0.1</samp> to
      <samp>meta=make-boat/0.2</samp>), as well as making other changes to the
      configuration if needed, like adding/removing the right variables.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Chaining Macros</h3>

      <p>If the user wanted to upgrade across multiple versions - e.g.
      <samp>0.1</samp> to <samp>0.4</samp> - there would need to be a chain of
      objects whose <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> was equal to the last
      <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp>, ending in an <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp> of
      <samp>0.4</samp>.</p>

      <p>We'll cover multiple version upgrading later in the tutorial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="skeleton">Upgrade Macro Skeleton</h3>

      <p>Upgrade macros are bits of Python code that essentially look like
      this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
class Upgrade272to273(rose.upgrade.MacroUpgrade):

    """Upgrade from 27.2 to 27.3."""

    BEFORE_TAG = "27.2"
    AFTER_TAG = "27.3"

    def upgrade(self, config, meta_config=None):
        """Upgrade the application configuration (config)."""
        # Some code doing something to config goes here.
        return config, self.reports
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Upgrade Macro Origin</h3>

      <p>They are sub-classes of a particular class,
      <samp>rose.upgrade.MacroUpgrade</samp>, which means that some of the
      Python functionality is done 'under the hood' to make things easier.</p>

      <p>You shouldn't need to know very much Python to get most things
      done.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="example-upgrade-macro">Example Upgrade Macro</h3>

      <p>Paste the following into your <samp>versions.py</samp> file:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
import rose.upgrade


class MyFirstUpgradeMacro(rose.upgrade.MacroUpgrade):

    """Upgrade from 0.1 (Canonical Canoe) to 0.2 (Outrageous Outrigger)."""

    BEFORE_TAG = "0.1"
    AFTER_TAG = "0.2"

    def upgrade(self, config, meta_config=None):
        """Upgrade the boat!"""
        # Some code doing something to config goes here.
        return config, self.reports
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example Upgrade Macro Explanation</h3>

      <p>This is already a functional upgrade macro - although it won't do
      anything. Note that the name of the class
      (<samp>MyFirstUpgradeMacro</samp>) doesn't need to be related to the
      versions - the only identifiers that matter are the
      <samp>BEFORE_TAG</samp> and the <samp>AFTER_TAG</samp>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Upgrade Macro API</h3>

      <p>We need to get the macro to do the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>add the option <samp>namelist:materials=misc_branches</samp></li>

        <li>add the option
        <samp>namelist:materials=outrigger_tree_trunks</samp></li>

        <li>add the option
        <samp>namelist:materials=paddling_branches</samp></li>

        <li>remove the option
        <samp>namelist:materials=paddling_twigs</samp></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Using the Upgrade Macro API</h3>

      <p>We can use the <a href="rose-api.html#upgrade">nice API</a> provided
      to express this in Python code - replace the <samp># Some code doing
      something...</samp> line with:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        self.add_setting(config, ["namelist:materials", "misc_branches"], "4")
        self.add_setting(
                 config, ["namelist:materials", "outrigger_tree_trunks"], "2")
        self.add_setting(
                 config, ["namelist:materials", "paddling_branches"], "1")
        self.remove_setting(config, ["namelist:materials", "paddling_twigs"])
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Upgrade Macro Explanation</h3>

      <p>This changes the app configuration (<samp>config</samp>) in the way we
      want, and (behind the scenes) adds some things to the
      <samp>self.reports</samp> list mentioned in the <samp>return config,
      self.reports</samp> line. Note that when we add options like
      <var>misc_branches</var>, we need values to add them with - what they are
      will often be a matter of judgement.</p>

      <p>However, even if they appear to be numeric inputs, values should
      always be entered as strings (<kbd>"1"</kbd> rather than
      <kbd>1</kbd>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Customising the Output</h3>

      <p>The methods <code>self.add_setting</code> and
      <code>self.remove_setting</code> will provide a default message to the
      user about the change (e.g. <samp>"Added X with value Y"</samp>), but you
      can customise them to add your own by passing an <var>info</var> 'keyword
      argument' like this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        self.add_setting(
                 config, ["namelist:materials", "outrigger_tree_trunks"], "2",
                 info="This makes it into a trimaran!")
</pre>

      <p>If you want to, try adding your own messages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="rose-app-upgrade">Running rose app-upgrade</h3>

      <p>Our upgrade macro will now work - change directory to the application
      directory and run:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
rose app-upgrade --meta-path=~/rose-meta/
</pre>

      <p><samp>--meta-path</samp> equals the path to the
      <samp>rose-meta/</samp> directory you created - as this path isn't
      configured in the site/user configuration, we need to set it manually.
      This won't normally be the case for users, if the metadata is centrally
      managed.</p>

      <p>This should display some information about the current and available
      versions - see the help by running <code>rose help
      app-upgrade</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Upgrading with rose app-upgrade</h3>

      <p>Let's upgrade to <samp>0.2</samp>. Run:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
rose app-upgrade --meta-path=~/rose-meta/ 0.2
</pre>

      <p>This should provide you with a summary of changes (including any
      custom messages you may have added) and prompt you to accept them. Accept
      them and have a look at the app config file - it should have been changed
      accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="patch">Using patch configurations</h3>

      <p>For relatively straightforward changes like the one above, we can
      configure a macro to apply patches to the configuration without having to
      write setting-specific Python code.</p>

      <p>We'll add a rudder option for our <samp>0.3</samp> version, with a
      <var>namelist:materials=l_rudder_branch</var>.</p>

      <p>Create a <kbd>0.3</kbd> directory in the same way that you created the
      <kbd>0.1</kbd> and <kbd>0.2</kbd> metadata directories. Add a
      <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file that looks like this:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Next Version Metadata</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[namelist:materials=hollow_tree_trunks]

[namelist:materials=l_rudder_branch]

type=integer
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Writing a Patch Macro</h3>

      <p>We need to write another macro in <samp>versions.py</samp> - append
      the following code:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
class MySecondUpgradeMacro(rose.upgrade.MacroUpgrade):

    """Upgrade from 0.2 (Outrageous Outrigger) to 0.3 (Amazing Ama)."""

    BEFORE_TAG = "0.2"
    AFTER_TAG = "0.3"

    def upgrade(self, config, meta_config=None):
        """Upgrade the boat!"""
        self.act_from_files(config)
        return config, self.reports
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Patch Macro Explanation</h3>

      <p>The <samp>self.act_from_files</samp> line tells the macro to look for
      patch configuration files - two files called
      <kbd>rose-macro-add.conf</kbd> and <kbd>rose-macro-remove.conf</kbd>,
      under an <kbd>etc/BEFORE_TAG/</kbd> subdirectory - in our case,
      <kbd>~/rose-meta/make-boat/etc/0.2/</kbd>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Patch Macro Explanation</h3>

      <p>Whatever is found in <kbd>rose-macro-add.conf</kbd> will be added to
      the configuration, and whatever is found in
      <kbd>rose-macro-remove.conf</kbd> will be removed. If the files don't
      exist, nothing will happen.</p>

      <p>Let's configure what we want to happen. Create a directory
      <kbd>~/rose-meta/make-boat/etc/0.2/</kbd>, containing a
      <samp>rose-macro-add.conf</samp> file that looks like this:</p>
      <pre>
[namelist:materials]
l_rudder_branch=.true.
</pre>

      <p>Note that if a <samp>rose-macro-add.conf</samp> setting is already
      defined, the value will not be overwritten. In our case, we don't need a
      <samp>rose-macro-remove.conf</samp> file.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Running rose app-upgrade</h3>

      <p>Go ahead and upgrade the app configuration to <kbd>0.3</kbd>, as you
      did before.</p>

      <p>The <samp>rose-app.conf</samp> should now contain the new option,
      <samp>l_rudder_branch</samp>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 id="complex">More Complex Upgrade Macros</h3>

      <p>The <a href="rose-api.html#upgrade">Upgrade Macro API</a> gives us
      quite a bit of power without having to write too much Python.</p>

      <p>For our <samp>1.0</samp> release, we want to add sailing gear - we
      need the number of <var>misc_branches</var> to be at least <kbd>6</kbd>,
      and add a <var>sail_canvas_sq_m</var> option.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding a Warning</h3>

      <p>We may want to issue a warning for a deprecated option
      (<var>paddle_branches</var>) so that the user can decide whether to
      remove it.</p>

      <p>Create a <kbd>~/rose-meta/make-boat/1.0</kbd> directory, with <a href=
      "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-upgrade-dev/rose-meta.conf.html">this
      content</a> in a <kbd>rose-meta.conf</kbd> file:</p>

      <p>We need to write a macro that reflects these changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">More Complex Upgrade Macro Example</h3>

      <p>We need to start with appending the following code to
      <samp>versions.py</samp>:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
class MyMoreComplexUpgradeMacro(rose.upgrade.MacroUpgrade):

    """Upgrade from 0.3 (Amazing Ama) to 1.0 (Tremendous Trimaran)."""

    BEFORE_TAG = "0.3"
    AFTER_TAG = "1.0"

    def upgrade(self, config, meta_config=None):
        """Upgrade the boat!"""
        # Some code doing something to config goes here.
        return config, self.reports
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example Replacement</h3>

      <p>We already know how to add an option, so replace <samp># Some code
      going here...</samp> with <kbd>self.add_setting(config,
      ["namelist:materials", "sail_canvas_sq_m"], "5")</kbd></p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">If Block</h3>

      <p>To perform the check/change in the number of <var>misc_branches</var>,
      we can insert the following lines after the one we just added:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        branch_num = self.get_setting_value(
               config, ["namelist:materials", "misc_branches"])
        if branch_num.isdigit() and float(branch_num) &lt; 6:
            self.change_setting_value(
                     config, ["namelist:materials", "misc_branches"], "6")
</pre>

      <p>This extracts the value of <var>misc_branches</var> (as a string!) and
      if the value represents a positive integer that is less than 6, changes
      it to <samp>"6"</samp>. It's good practice to guard against the
      possibility that a user might have set the value to a non-integer
      representation like <samp>'many'</samp> - if we don't do this, the macro
      may crash out when running things like <code>float</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding a Warning</h3>

      <p>In a similar way, to flag a warning, insert:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        paddles = self.get_setting_value(
                       config, ["namelist:materials", "paddling_branches"])
        if paddles is not None:
            self.add_report("namelist:materials", "paddling_branches",
                            paddles, info="Deprecated - probably not needed.",
                            is_warning=True)
</pre>

      <p>This calls <samp>self.add_report</samp> if the option
      <samp>paddling_branches</samp> is present. This is a method that notifies
      the user of actions and issues by appending things to the
      <samp>self.reports</samp> list which appears on the <samp>return
      ...</samp>line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Running the Complex Macro</h3>

      <p>Run <kbd>rose app-upgrade --meta-path=~/rose-meta/ 1.0</kbd> to see
      the effect of your changes. You should see a warning message for
      <var>namelist:materials=paddling_branches</var> as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Upgrading Many Versions at Once</h3>

      <p>We've kept in step with the metadata by upgrading incrementally, but
      typically users will need to upgrade across multiple versions. When this
      happens, the relevant macros will be applied in turn, and their changes
      and issues aggregated.</p>

      <p>Turn back the clock by reverting your application configuration to
      look like it was at <samp>0.1</samp>:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
meta=make-boat/0.1

[namelist:materials]
hollow_tree_trunks=1
paddling_twigs=1
</pre>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose app-upgrade Across Versions</h3>

        <p>Run <kbd>rose app-upgrade --meta-path=~/rose-meta/</kbd> in the
        application directory. You should see the available versions to upgrade
        to - let's choose <samp>1.0</samp>. Run:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
rose app-upgrade --meta-path=~/rose-meta/ 1.0
</pre>

        <p>This should aggregate all the changes that our macros make - if you
        accept the changes, it will upgrade all the way to the <samp>1.0</samp>
        version we had before.</p>
