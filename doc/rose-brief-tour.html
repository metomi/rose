    <h1>Rose User Guide: A Brief Tour</h1>

    <div id="content"></div>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>This chapter of the Rose user guide attempts to introduce you to various
    aspects of Rose by using a simple example. It assumes that Rose, <a href=
    "http://hjoliver.github.com/cylc/">Cylc</a> and <a href=
    "http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/fcm/">FCM</a> are
    already installed and configured correctly on your system.</p>

    <p>Rose gives powerful command line utilities, and can be entirely used
    within a terminal and text editor. Rose also contains graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) for optional use. We'll give a brief tour of the command
    line interface, and then discuss the GUIs.</p>

    <h2 id="cli">Command Line Tour</h2>

    <p>This section takes us through the command line and text editor interface
    to Rose.</p>

    <h3>Create a Suite</h3>

    <p>We'll begin by looking at whether a suite for this user guide is already
    installed at your site. If so, you can simply copy it. Otherwise, you will
    need to create a new suite and populate it.</p>

    <p>Open a Linux/Unix terminal, issue the command:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rosie lookup -Q title eq 'RUG brief tour'
</pre>

    <p>If it returns something like the following example, you can copy it into
    a new suite:</p>
    <pre>
mo1-ro513/trunk@100     rosemary        rose    RUG brief tour
</pre>

    <p>Otherwise, you will have to create a new suite and populate it
    yourself.</p>

    <p>To create a new suite, and copy items from an existing suite, e.g.
    <samp>mo1-ro513</samp>, issue the command:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rosie copy mo1-ro513
</pre>

    <p>To create an empty new suite, issue the command:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rosie create
</pre>

    <p>Both commands will prompt you to edit the suite discovery information
    file. Edit the <em>project</em> and/or <em>title</em> settings if you want.
    Save the file and exit the editor. A new suite will be created in the
    version control system, with a local copy created (i.e. checked out) at
    <samp>$HOME/roses/$ID</samp> where <var>$ID</var> is a unique ID for the
    new suite.</p>

    <h3>Populate and/or Modify the Suite</h3>

    <p>Change directory to the local copy of the suite, if you have not already
    done so. If you are not copying from an existing suite, populate your suite
    by running the following commands:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
cd $HOME/roses/$ID # replace $ID with the ID of your new suite
rose rug-brief-tour
</pre>

    <p>You will find the following files and sub-directories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <kbd>rose-suite.conf</kbd> file: This is used to define suite
      configurations outside of cylc. E.g. inputs to the cylc suite
      configuration file, files to install at run time, etc. It is left empty
      in this example suite.</li>

      <li>A <kbd>suite.rc</kbd> file: This is used to define configurations in
      a cylc suite. In this example, we are running:

        <ul>
          <li><code>fcm_make</code>: a task to build an executable from a
          source file containing a <em>hello world</em> program</li>

          <li><code>fred_hello_world</code>, <code>my_hello_mars</code>,
          <code>my_hello_world</code>: Rose <em>applications</em> that invoke
          the <em>hello world</em> executable using different
          configurations.</li>

          <li><code>locate_fred</code>: a preparation task run each time before
          <code>fred_hello_world</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a <em>cycling</em> suite that repeats every 6 hours, with
        the first cycle starting at <samp>2013010100</samp> (00:00, 1 January
        2013) and the last cycle starting 1 day later at
        <samp>2013010200</samp> (00:00, 2 January 2013). Cycling suites
        typically need special start tasks to boot up - in our case,
        <code>fcm_make</code> is run at the beginning of the suite, before any
        cycles.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Sub-directories:

        <ul>
          <li><kbd>app/</kbd>: This directory contains the configurations of
          the <em>applications</em> run by the <em>tasks</em> of the suite. In
          this example suite, the directory contains 3 sets of application
          configurations for running the <em>hello world</em> program in 3
          different modes.</li>

          <li><kbd>etc/</kbd>: This directory contains miscellaneous files used
          by tasks in the suite. In this example suite, the directory contains
          the <kbd>fcm-make.cfg</kbd> file for the <var>fcm_make</var>
          task.</li>

          <li><kbd>src/</kbd>: This directory contains the source file of a
          simple program that we shall run in this suite. Note: This directory
          will not normally be present in a real scientific suite, as source
          files are typically held in separate locations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>At this point, you may want to have a look at the files before moving on
    to the next section. You may also want to commit your suite back to the
    central repository if you have newly created it or made any changes.</p>

    <h3>Run the Suite</h3>

    <p>Install and run the suite by using the following command:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
cd $HOME/roses/$ID # replace $ID with the ID of your new suite
rose suite-run
</pre>

    <p>This will install your suite under <var>$HOME/cylc-run/$ID</var>, start
    your suite with <code>cylc</code> and fire up <code>cylc gcontrol
    $ID</code>. Experiment with different viewing options on the <code>cylc
    gcontrol</code>toolbar. The suite should run successfully to
    completion.</p>

    <p>Note: If you quit <code>cylc gcontrol</code> by mistake, you can restart
    it by typing <code>rose suite-gcontrol $ID</code> on the command line.</p>

    <h3>View the Output</h3>

    <p>The output of your suite can be found at
    <var>$HOME/cylc-run/$ID</var>.</p>

    <p>The sub-directory <samp>log/</samp> contains the log files produced by
    the suite. In particular, the <samp>log/job/</samp> directory contains the
    STDOUT and STDERR from each task together with the script used to run the
    task.</p>

    <p>The sub-directory <samp>log/</samp> also contains a HTML-based viewer
    which allows you to view the output from a completed suite via a web
    browser. E.g.:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
cd $HOME/cylc-run/$ID # replace $ID with the ID of your new suite
firefox log/index.html
</pre>

    <p>Alternatively, you can type <code>rose suite-log-view $ID</code> to 
    launch your browser and view the output of your suite without having to 
    navigate to its folder.</p>

    <p>The <samp>share/</samp> sub-directory is used by the tasks in the suite
    to share files. In this example suite, the build created by the
    <var>fcm_make</var> task can be found here.</p>

    <p>The <samp>work/</samp> sub-directory contains the working directory for
    the tasks at their run times. It can be used by the tasks to create files
    that are only relevant to the tasks.</p>

    <p>You should commit your suite if you have just created it or made any
    changes. Tidy up by removing your <samp>roses/$ID</samp> directory:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rm -rf $HOME/roses/$ID # replace $ID with the ID of your new suite
</pre>

    <p>You can recover your suite at any time by running:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rosie checkout $ID # replace $ID with the ID of your new suite
</pre>

    <p>For help with Rose and Rosie commands, see the <a href=
    "rose-command.html">Command Reference</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="gui">GUI Tour</h2>

    <p>This section explores working using the Rose system GUIs. You should
    complete the above command line tour before starting this one.</p>

    <h3>Suite Discovery GUI</h3>

    <p>We'll use the discovery GUI to find and checkout our example suite. Open
    a Linux/Unix terminal and issue the command:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rosie go
</pre>

    <p>You should see a list of your suites as rows in a table.</p>

    <p>You could find other suites by using the toolbar search and searching
    for text strings, or using the advanced query panel (show it by clicking
    the rightmost toolbar button).</p>

    <p>There are toolbar options to create and copy suites. Copying and other
    actions can be done by right clicking on a suite.</p>

    <p>Look at the list to find the row that has the suite $ID, project, and
    title from the command line tour. If you double-click on it, your suite
    will be checked out and then the Rose configuration editor GUI will be
    launched.</p>

    <p>Go ahead and double click on your suite.</p>

    <h3>Config Editor GUI</h3>

    <p>The config editor should have started up with a view of your suite.</p>

    <p>You can see from the toolbar that you can perform actions like
    <samp>Undo</samp>, <samp>Redo</samp> and <samp>Find</samp>.</p>

    <p>On the left hand side is a panel containing a tree with named nodes. If
    you expand these, you can see that this represents the suite and
    application configurations. Each section in a configuration is (normally) a
    node here. Navigate to the application section <samp>my_hello_saturn</samp>
    -&gt; <samp>env</samp> and click on <samp>env</samp>.</p>

    <p>A page should have launched in the right hand panel. This contains
    widgets for altering the <samp>env</samp> section of the application
    <samp>my_hello_saturn</samp>.</p>

    <p>Try altering the value of some of the settings, either using the text
    box or the spin (numeric) buttons. When the settings are a different value
    to the saved ones, their names will change colour. You can
    <samp>Undo</samp> and <samp>Redo</samp> your actions. You can also
    <samp>Save</samp> your changes.</p>

    <p>If you move the mouse over the setting names, you can see some
    descriptive text. You can access further help by clicking the little menu
    button next to the setting name and selecting <samp>Help</samp> or
    <samp>Web Help</samp>.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can run your suite by clicking the <samp>Suite Run</samp>
    button on the toolbar or selecting Tools -&gt; Run Suite -&gt; Default
    from the top menu. This will invoke <code>rose suite-run</code>.</p>
