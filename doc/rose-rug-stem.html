    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This part of the Rose user guide explains how to use the <samp>rose
      stem</samp> testing system, and the motivation behind it.</p>

      <p><samp>rose stem</samp> requires the use of <a href=
      "https://github.com/metomi/fcm">FCM</a> as it requires some of the
      version control information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

      <p>Why do we test code?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation II</h3>

      <p>Most people would answer something along the lines of "so we know it
      works".</p>

      <p>However, this is really asking two related but separate questions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Does the code do what I meant it to do?</li>

        <li>Does the code do anything I didn't mean it to do?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation III</h3>

      <p>Answering the first question may involve writing a bespoke test and
      checking the results. The second question can at least partially be
      answered by using an automated testing system which runs predefined tasks
      and presents the answers. <samp>rose stem</samp> is a system for doing
      this.</p>

      <p><em>N.B. When writing tests for new code, they should be added to the
      testing system so that future developers can be confident that they
      haven't broken the new functionality.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>There are two components in rose stem:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><samp>rose stem</samp> - the command line tool which executes an
        appropriate suite.</li>

        <li><samp>rose ana</samp> - a Rose task app which can compare the
        result of a task against a control.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will describe each in turn. It is intended that a test suite lives
      alongside the code in the same version-controlled project, which should
      encourage developers to update the test suite when they update the code.
      This means that the test suite will always be a valid test of the code it
      is accompanying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="rose-stem">Running a suite with <samp>rose stem</samp></h2>

      <p>The <code>rose stem</code> command is essentially a wrapper to
      <code>rose suite-run</code>, which accepts some additional arguments and
      converts them to Jinja2 variables which the suite can interpret.</p>

      <p>These arguments are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>--source</code> - specifies a source tree to include in a
        suite.</li>

        <li><code>--group</code> - specifies a group of tasks to run.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A <em>group</em> is a set of Rose tasks which together test a certain
      configuration of a program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The <code>--source</code> argument</h2>

      <p>The source argument provides a set of Jinja2 variables which can then
      be included in any compilation tasks in a suite. You can specify multiple
      <code>--source</code> arguments on the command line. For example:</p>
      <pre>
rose stem --source=/path/to/workingcopy --source=fcm:other_project_tr@head
</pre>

      <p>Each source tree is associated with a project (via an <samp>fcm</samp>
      command) when <code>rose stem</code> is run on the command line. This
      project name is then used in the construction of the Jinja2 variable
      names.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source II</h3>

      <p>Each project has a Jinja2 variable <code>SOURCE_FOO</code> where FOO
      is the project name. This contains a space-separated list of all source
      trees belonging to that project, which can then be given to an
      appropriate build task in the suite so it builds those source trees.</p>

      <p>The first source specified must be a working copy which contains the
      <samp>rose stem</samp> suite. The suite is expected to be in a
      subdirectory named <code>rose-stem</code> off the top of the working
      copy. This source is used to generate two additional variables:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_BASE</code> - the base directory of the
        project</li>

        <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_REV</code> - the revision of the project (if
        any)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These settings <b>override</b> the variables in the
      <code>rose-suite.conf</code> file.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source III</h3>

      <p>These should allow the use of configuration files which control the
      build process inside the working copy, e.g. you can refer to:</p>
      <pre>
      {{SOURCE_FOO_BASE}}/fcm-make/configs/machine.cfg{{SOURCE_FOO_REV}}
</pre>

      <p>If you omit the source argument, <samp>rose stem</samp> defaults to
      assuming</p>
      <pre>
rose stem --source=.
</pre>

      <p>viz. that the current directory is part of the working copy which
      should be added as a source tree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The <code>--group</code> argument</h2>

      <p>The group argument is used to provide a Pythonic list of groups in the
      variable <samp>RUN_NAMES</samp> which can then be looped over in a suite
      to switch sets of tasks on and off.</p>

      <p>Each <code>--group</code> argument adds another group to the list. For
      example:</p>
      <pre>
rose stem --group=mygroup --group=myothergroup
</pre>

      <p>runs two groups named <em>mygroup</em> and <em>myothergroup</em> with
      the current working copy. The suite will then interpret these into a set
      of tasks which build with the given source tree(s), run the program, and
      compare the output.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>The <code>--task</code> argument</h3>

      <p>The <code>--task</code> argument is provided as a synonym for
      <code>--group</code>. Depending on how exactly the <samp>rose stem</samp>
      suite works users may find one of these arguments more intuitive to use
      than the other.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <h2 id="rose-ana">Comparing output with <samp>rose ana</samp></h2>

        <p>Any task beginning with <i>rose_ana_</i> will be interpreted by Rose
        as a <samp>rose ana</samp> task, and run through the <samp>rose
        ana</samp> task app.</p>

        <p>A <samp>rose ana</samp> <code>rose-app.conf</code> file contains a
        series of blocks which each contain the names of two files to compare,
        a method of extracting the data from the file, and a method to compare
        the data. Each block is given a human-readable description of the
        test.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana II</h3>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre>
  [Compare data from myfile]
  comparison=Exact
  extract=OutputGrepper:'data value:(\d+)'
  kgo1file=/data/kgo/myfile
  resultfile=../run.1/myfile

</pre>

        <p>This tells <samp>rose ana</samp> to take the contents of the file
        <code>../run.1/myfile</code> (which is relative to the <samp>rose
        ana</samp> task's <code>work</code> directory) and the contents of
        <code>/data/kgo/myfile</code> and run the built-in OutputGrepper method
        on each file. This particular method runs an arbitrary regular
        expression on the file, producing a list of items which match the first
        group. In this case, the regular expression is <code>data
        value:(\d+)</code>. The comparison method is exact, so anything other
        than an exact match will cause a failure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana III</h3>

        <p>It is possible to add additional comparison and extraction methods
        to <samp>rose ana</samp> by setting the <code>method-path</code>
        variable in the <code>rose ana</code> section of the
        <code>rose.conf</code> file.</p>

        <p>A list of available methods can be found by listing the contents of
        the <code>lib/python/rose/apps/comparisons</code> subdirectory inside
        your <samp>Rose</samp> installation. The default installation
        includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>OutputGrepper</samp> - an extraction method for running
          regular expressions on files</li>

          <li><samp>Exact</samp> - a comparison method for comparing two lists
          are identical</li>

          <li><samp>Within</samp> - a comparison method for comparing that the
          contents of one list are within a certain percentage or range of the
          other. This uses an additional <code>tolerance</code> value in the
          <code>rose-app.conf</code> file</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana IV</h3>

        <p>There are two further comparison methods which use the OutputGrepper
        extraction method to check whether particular strings exist in a
        file or not. These operate only the the <code>resultfile</code> variable,
        no KGO file is needed. The methods are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>Mandatory</samp> - will fail if the text specified in
          OutputGrepper is not present in the file.</li>

          <li><samp>Prohibited</samp> - will fail if the text specified in
          OutputGrepper is present in the file.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h2 id="rose-ana-db">The <samp>rose ana</samp> comparison database</h2>

        <p>In addition to performing the comparisons each of the
        <code>rose ana</code> tasks in the suite will append some key details
        about the comparisons to an <code>sqlite</code> database kept in the
        suite's <code>log</code> directory (at
        <code>log/rose-ana-comparisons.db</code>).</p>

        <p>This is intended to provide a quick means to interrogate the suite
        for information about the status of any comparisons it has performed.
        There are 2 tables present in the suite which contain the following:</p>

      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana db II</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>tasks (TABLE)</samp> Contains an entry for each
            <code>rose ana</code> task, using the following columns:
            <ul>
              <li><samp>task_name (TEXT)</samp> The exact name of the
                <code>rose ana</code> task.</li>
              <li><samp>completed (INT)</samp> Set to 1 when the task starts
                performing its comparisons then updated to 0 when the task
                has completed (Note: task success is not related to the
                success/failed state of the comparisons).</li>
            </ul>
            The intention of this table is to detect if any
            <code>rose ana</code> tasks have failed unexpectedly (or are still
            running).</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana db III</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><samp>comparisons</samp> Contains an entry for each individual
            comparison from every <code>rose ana</code> task, using the
            following columns:
            <ul>
              <li><samp>app_task (TEXT)</samp> A composite of the exact name
                of the <code>rose ana</code> task and the comparison section
                name from the app defintion (in brackets).</li>
              <li><samp>kgo_file (TEXT)</samp> The full path to the file given
                as <code>kgo1file</code> in the app definition.</li>
              <li><samp>suite_file (TEXT)</samp> The full path to the file
                given as <code>resultfile</code> in the app definition.</li>
              <li><samp>status (TEXT)</samp> The status of the task, as
                reported by <code>rose ana</code> (i.e. " OK ", "FAIL" or
                "WARN").</li>
              <li><samp>comparison (TEXT)</samp> Another composite, this time
                it contains the <code>comparison</code> and <code>extract</code>
                in the app definition, delimited by colons.</li>
            </ul>
            The intention of this table is to provide a record of which files
            were compared by which tasks, how they were compared and what the
            result of the comparison was.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana db IV</h3>
        <p>Although this database is produced by a <code>rose stem</code> suite,
        the system does not provide any direct methods for working with or
        interrogating it - since there could be various reasons for doing so,
        and there may be other suite-design factors to consider.  Users are
        therefore expected to provide this functionality separately based on
        their specific needs.</p>

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

        <p>From within a working copy, running <samp>rose stem</samp> is
        simple. Just run</p>
        <pre class="shell">
rose stem --group=groupname
