    <h2 id="suite-search">Locating Suites</h2>

    <h3 id="home">Checked Out Suites</h3>

    <p>To see what suites you have checked out on your machine click the <kbd>
    Show local suites</kbd> button in the address bar (usually represented 
    using your system's home button icon). This will display a list
    of all the suites you have checked out relating to the current 
    repository you are viewing. For help on switching to a different repository 
    see <a href="#repo-change">Switching Repository</a>.</p>
    
    <p>When running searches, suites you have checked out will have 
    an icon in the "local" column of the search results indicating the status
    of the local copy e.g. modified, older, newer etc. If no icon is shown 
    then no local copy of that suite has been found.</p>

    <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
    
    <p>The simplest method available for locating suites is to use the search 
    function. Type a word or phrase into the search box and either click the 
    search button or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and a search will be run for suites
    containing the entered word/phrase in <strong>any</strong> of their 
    properties. Results are shown in the results panel.</p>
    
    <p>The same behaviour can also be obtained by typing search phrases in the 
    address box - similar to many web browsers. Note that the search phrase 
    entered in the address box should not begin with <code>http</code> or it 
    will be interpreted as a url. Should you wish to search for words/phrases 
    beginning <code>http</code> then you will need to use the search box.</p>
    
    <h3 id="query">Running a Query</h3>
    
    <p>Queries allow you to run more advanced suite searches, filtering results
    based on the values of particular properties.</p>
    
    <p>If it is not already visible, the advanced search pane can be shown by 
    clicking the <kbd>Show/hide the advanced search pane</kbd> button at the 
    end of the address bar.</p>
    
    <p>Queries are constructed by creating and combining filters comparing 
    suite properties to various values. Each filter takes up a row in the 
    advanced search pane. Use the drop down boxes to set filter operators,  
    the property to be examined and the comparison operator to be 
    used. The value against which the property is to be compared against (using
    your selected comparison operator) should be entered in the value box.</p>
    
    <p>Additional filters can be added to the query by clicking the <kbd>Add 
    filter</kbd> button. Similarly, individual filters can be removed by 
    clicking the <kbd>Remove query filter</kbd> button found next to their 
    value box. Should you wish to remove all the filters click the 
    <kbd>Clear filters</kbd> button.</p>
    
    <p>Once you are happy with the query you have set up, click the 
    <kbd>Query</kbd> button to run it. As with running a search, results are 
    shown in the results panel below.</p>
    
    <p>More complex queries can be constructed using brackets. To enable use of
    bracketing click <kbd>View -> View advanced controls</kbd>. Combo boxes 
    will then be added to the start and end of each filter allowing you to 
    select the level of bracketing desired.</p>
    
    <h3 id="url">Using a URL</h3>
    
    <p>To search for suites using a url, type the url into the address box and 
    press <kbd>enter</kbd>. The relevant search will then be run and results 
    displayed. Note that running a search with a url will search the repository
    <strong>specified by the url</strong> rather than the one you currently 
    have set.</p>
    
    <p>Notice that after running a search or query the address box is updated 
    with the url for that search or query. This can be copied and re-used in 
    <kbd>rosie lookup</kbd> or shared with others so they can quickly run the 
    same search by pasting the url into their address box or using it with 
    <kbd>rosie lookup</kbd> rather than having to set up the same search by 
    hand.</p>
    
    <h3 id="history">Re-running Past Searches</h3>
    
    <p>As you run various suite searches within <kbd>rosie go</kbd> they are 
    recorded in your search history. To view your history, either click 
    <kbd>History -> Show search history</kbd> or use the keyboard shortcut 
    <kbd>Ctrl-H</kbd></p>
    
    <p>The Search History panel should now be displayed on the left-hand side 
    of <kbd>rosie go</kbd> listing your past searches with their <strong>
    type</strong> - "search", "query" or "url", the <strong>parameters</strong>
    you used and whether or not you asked for <strong>all revisions</strong> 
    of the returned suites.</p>
    
    <p>You can order the results by type, parameters or whether you asked to 
    see all revisions by clicking on the relevent column head.</p>
    
    <p>To re-run one of these searches simply click on it. The search will 
    then be set up and run.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to clear your search history then click <kbd>History -> Clear 
    history</kbd>. You will be asked to confirm this.</p>
    
    <p>To close the history panel you can either close it by unticking <kbd>show 
    search history</kbd> in the History menu, using the keyboard shortcut or 
    simply clicking the close button at the top of the history panel.</p>
    
    <p><strong>N.B.</strong> <kbd>rosie go</kbd> only stores a limited number 
    of past searches (100 by default) so older, less used searches will 
    disappear from the history menu as new ones are run.</p>
    
    <h3 id="view-revisions">Searching for All Suite Revisions</h3>
    
    <p>For details on how to search for all revisions of a suite rather than 
    just the latest see <a href="#all-revisions">Viewing All Revisions of a 
    Suite</a>.
    
    <h2 id="management">Suite Management</h2>
    
    <h3 id="create">Creating a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To create a <strong>new suite</strong> click <kbd>File -> New Suite</kbd>.
    A wizard will then launch for you to enter suite discovery information 
    and confirm suite creation.</p>
    
    <p>To create a suite <strong>from an existing suite</strong>, right click 
    on the suite you wish to create from and click <kbd>Copy Suite</kbd>. As 
    with creating a new suite this will launch a wizard for you to edit suite 
    discovery information in.</p>
    
    <h3 id="checkout">Checking Out an Existing Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To checkout a suite select it from the search results and click the 
    <kbd>Checkout</kbd> button on the toolbar. Alternatively, right click the 
    suite and select <kbd>Checkout Suite</kbd> from the popup menu.</p>
    
    <p>Suites you have checked out can be identified
    by having an icon in the "local" column of the results table. You can also
    see all suites you have checked out from the current repository by clicking
    the <kbd>Show local suites</kbd> button on the address bar.</p>
    
    <h3 id="delete">Deleting a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To delete <strong>all branches of, the trunk and any working
    copy of a suite</strong>, right click on the suite in search results and
    select <kbd>Delete Suite</kbd> from the pop-up menu. A dialog will then 
    appear asking you to confirm you wish to go ahead with the deletion.</p>
    
    <p>To delete <strong>only your working copy</strong> of a suite right click
    on it and select <kbd>Delete Working Copy</kbd> and press OK in the dialog 
    that appears. Note that if you have any uncommitted changes in your working
    copy the option will be disabled until you either commit or revert the 
    suite.</p>
    
    <h3 id="edit">Editing a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To edit a suite you have checked out, right click on it and select 
    <kbd>Edit Suite</kbd>. This will launch the <kbd>rose config-edit</kbd> 
    GUI with that suite open.</p>
    
    <h3 id="run">Running a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To run a suite, select a suite from the results panel and press the
    run suite button in the toolbar. If you would like to run a suite with some
    arguments right click it and select <kbd>Run Suite ...</kbd>. This will 
    display a dialog box for entry of the desired arguments.</p>
    
    <p>N.B. you can only run suites you have checked out.</p>
    
    <h2 id="view">Viewing Suite Information</h2>

    <h3 id="info">Getting More Information About a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To obtain more information about a suite listed in the search results 
    you can do one of two things; hold your mouse over the suite to display a
    tooltip containing more details or right click on the suite and click 
    <kbd>Info</kbd> in the pop-up menu to display a dialog box containing further 
    details.</p>
    
    <h3 id="group">Grouping Results by Column</h3>
    
    <p>To group results by column right click on a result in the column you 
    wish to group by then click <kbd>Group Column</kbd> in the menu that 
    appears. For example, to group by results by owner right click in the owner
    column and click <kbd>Group Column</kbd>. To ungroup results right click on
    any of them and click <kbd>Ungroup</kbd> in the pop-up menu. Results may 
    only be grouped by one column at a time.</p>
    
    <h3 id="sort">Ordering Results</h3>

    <p>Suite search results can be ordered by property in either ascending or 
    descending order. To do so, click on the column title for the property you 
    wish to order by so an arrow is displayed next to it indicating the order 
    in which the property is being sorted.</p>
    
    <h3 id="column-view">Show/Hide Result Properties</h3>
    
    <p>To show or hide columns displayed in the search results open the "View" 
    menu and toggle the relevant check boxes on or off. The affected columns 
    will then be either shown or hidden in the current results and those from 
    subsequent searches. These settings will reset when you open a new
    <kbd>rosie go</kbd> session.</p>

    <h3 id="all-revisions">Viewing All Revisions of a Suite</h3>
    
    <p>To view all revisions of a suite in the repository you can either toggle
    the <kbd>View all revisions</kbd> box in the toolbar or click <kbd>View ->
    toggle all revisions</kbd> and then run your search. Checking the <kbd>View
    all revisions</kbd> box will not update the current results.</p>

    <h2 id="other">Other Features</h2>

    <h3 id="refresh">Refresh Results</h3>
    
    <p>From time to time you may find you want to refresh the search results 
    being shown - perhaps as a result of collaborating on suite development.
    To do so either click the <kbd>Refresh</kbd> button on the address bar, or 
    use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>F5</kbd>. Note that this re-runs the last 
    search you carried out, so any changes in the GUI won't be picked up.</p>
    
    <h3 id="navigation">Search Navigation</h3>
    
    <p>While <kbd>rosie go</kbd> is open it keeps track of the various searches
    you run and allows you to navigate back to previous searches. By clicking 
    on the back and forward arrows you can navigate through the searches you 
    have run in the current session. Alternatively, you can make use of the 
    keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Alt-left</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-right</kbd> to move
    backwards and forwards respectively.</p>
    
    <h3 id="repo-change">Switching Repository</h3>
    
    <p><kbd>rosie go</kbd> enables you to search for suites stored in different 
    repositories by allowing you to swap between different sources. To change 
    repository click on <kbd>Edit -&gt; Data source</kbd> and then the name of the 
    repository you wish to work with. On changing repository, <kbd>rosie 
    go</kbd> will display your checked out suites for that repository.</p>
    
    <p>You can tell what repository you are currently in from the title bar - 
    <kbd>X - rosie go</kbd>, where X is the name of the repository - and from 
    the data source shown in the left hand side of the status bar at the bottom
    of the window.</p>
    
    <h3 id="output">Viewing Suite Output</h3>
    
    <p>If you have run a suite and want to view its output select it in the 
    results list, right click it and click <kbd>View Output</kbd>. A web 
    browser will be opened allowing you to look at the suite output. 
    Alternatively, you can view a suite and click the <kbd>View Output</kbd> 
    button on the toolbar. If no output is available to look at then the menu 
    option and button will be greyed out.</p>
