    <h1>Rose Documentation: What is Rose?</h1>

    <div id="content"></div>

    <p>Rose is a group of utilities and specifications aimed to provide a
    common way to manage the development and running of scientific application
    suites in both research and production environments. Rose enables users to
    follow these principles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A suite and the applications it runs should be driven mainly by
      configurations that can easily be understood and modified by a human user
      as well as a computer.</li>

      <li>A suite should work with no modifications when it is run by a
      different user of the same site.</li>

      <li>It should require minimum efforts to port a suite between old and new
      platforms, between sites, and between research and production
      environments. Where possible, it should be easy to abstract away
      unportable site configurations.</li>

      <li>Configurations for driving scientific applications should be portable
      between related suites.</li>

      <li>Configurations for driving a scientific suite should be version
      controlled. The results generated by running such a suite should be easily
      identifiable in the archive environment.</li>

      <li>Rose utilities should be driven by well defined configurations. Any
      site and/or application specific logic should be configurable.</li>

      <li>Rose GUI utilities will provide a nice way to access a set of
      functionalities, but will not be the only way to access those
      functionalities (unless they are GUI specific).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Rose has the following components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Application configuration and runner: Rose provides a simple and
      portable configuration driven application runner to run individual
      scientific applications in suite tasks.</li>

      <li>Configuration editor GUI: Rose provides a powerful metadata driven GUI
      for viewing, editing, checking, transforming, etc. suite and application
      configurations. The behaviour of the GUI can be easily modified on the fly
      by modifying the metadata associated with the suite and application
      configurations.</li>

      <li>Suite engine: Rose uses <a href=
      "http://hjoliver.github.com/cylc/">Cylc</a> as the main engine for running
      suites.</li>

      <li>Common suite utilities: Rose provides various utilities to allow
      suites to be written in a common way. This includes a configuration driven
      installer to install and start a Cylc suite, a task runner to allow most
      wrap most suite tasks in a common way, a task hook to notify task failures
      and interact with the suite output viewer, etc.</li>

      <li>Suite output viewer: While a suite engine would normally provide its
      own monitoring tools to monitor a running suite, they do not normally
      cover tasks that are no longer current and they cannot normally interact
      with a stopped suite. Rose provides an easy way to generate an HTML-based
      suite output viewer to display nicely the list of completed tasks and
      their outputs.</li>

      <li>Suite storage and discovery: Rose suites are just files in a directory
      hierarchy, so they can be stored anywhere. To avoid chaos, however, Rose
      provides a solution to allow suites to be hosted centrally using a version
      control system. This allows suites to be easily identifiable, shared,
      compared and retrieved by different users. Each centrally hosted suite
      will provide an identity file, which the system can use to populate a
      database. Users can discover relevant suites by querying the
      database.</li>
    </ul>
