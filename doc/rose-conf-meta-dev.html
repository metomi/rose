    <h1>Rose User Guide: Configuration Metadata Development</h1>

    <div id="content"></div>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Configuration Metadata is used to provide information about settings in
    Rose configurations. It is intended to help document your inputs, perform
    automatic checking (including whether an input is needed), and to enhance
    the interface to your configurations in e.g. the Rose config editor.</p>

    <p>For reference and a fuller picture of Rose configuration metadata,
    please refer to the <a href="rose-configuration.html#meta">Rose Reference Guide
    &gt; Configuration Metadata</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

    <p>This example uses the Rose example suite from the <a href=
    "rose-brief-tour.html">brief tour</a> and assumes that you are familiar
    with it and have it to hand. Otherwise, go back to the brief tour
    and follow the instructions to check it out or recreate it.</p>

    <p>We are going to develop metadata for the app <code>my_hello_mars</code>.
    Change directory to the suite directory, then change directory to
    <code>app/my_hello_mars</code>.</p>

    <p>Open the Rose application file (<code>rose-app.conf</code>) in this
    directory. It should look like this:</p>
    <pre>
[command]
default = hello.exe

[env]
MAX_TARGETS = 5
LANG_JUPITER = Europan
WORLD = Mars

</pre>

    <p>Open the application in the Rose config editor:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
rose edit
</pre>

    <p>Look at the page <code>env</code>. The three options
    <var>LANG_JUPITER</var>, <var>MAX_TARGETS</var>, <var>WORLD</var> appear in
    raw form - there are no special widgets for the number in
    <var>MAX_TARGETS</var> and no hover-over descriptions of the variables or
    help. We actually haven't added any value over the raw text. Let's close
    the config editor for now.</p>

    <p>Let's create a metadata directory and start adding some information.</p>

    <p>If we were in a hurry, we could use the <code>rose metadata-gen</code>
    command which will populate a metadata configuration based on an
    application or suite configuration. It can make educated guesses about
    variable types as well (option <code>--auto-type</code>). This provides a
    base for further development, and saves a lot of typing. We'll ignore it
    for the purposes of this guide.</p>

    <p>Create the sub directory <code>meta</code> in your application
    directory:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
mkdir meta
</pre>

    <p>This is where Rose will look for our metadata by default. We'll add a
    metadata file by running:</p>
    <pre class="shell">
touch meta/rose-meta.conf
</pre>

    <p>This is where the main metadata configuration lives. Open the file in a
    text editor.</p>

    <p>Let's provide some type information about <var>MAX_TARGETS</var>. The id
    for this variable is <var>env=MAX_TARGETS</var>, so add a section into the
    file.:</p>
    <pre>
[env=MAX_TARGETS]
</pre>

    <p>We can specify that it's an integer by giving it a type:</p>
    <pre>
[env=MAX_TARGETS]
type = integer
</pre>

    <p>We could also improve the way it's displayed by giving it a title:</p>
    <pre>
[env=MAX_TARGETS]
title = Max target number
type = integer
</pre>

    <p>Now if we save the file and open the application in the config editor
    again, we see that the value of <var>MAX_TARGETS</var> now appears in a
    special numeric widget, and that the title has replaced the name. You can 
    see the difference easily by switching metadata off and on (toggle
    <code>Metadata</code> Menu -&gt; Switch off Metadata).</p>

    <p>Setting the type does more than change the widget - it also instructs
    Rose to check that the input is valid for that type. If the value of
    <var>MAX_TARGETS</var> was <samp>5.6</samp> or <samp>banana</samp>,
    (anything non-integer) an error would be flagged.</p>

    <p>We've set the type of <var>MAX_TARGETS</var> to <samp>integer</samp>,
    but we haven't ruled out choices of integer that would crash our code, such
    as negative integers. We need to restrict the number using a range. To do
    this add a range as follows:</p>
    <pre>
[env=MAX_TARGETS]
range = 0:
title = Max target number
type = integer
</pre>

    <p>This means that any integer less than zero will be flagged as a problem.
    With the Metadata switched on, try decreasing the value of <var>MAX_TARGETS
    </var> below zero. An error will be flagged next to the variable and on the
    page list in the left hand panel. If you change it to an integer value of
    zero or greater, the error will go away.</p>

    <p>Let's now make <var>env=WORLD</var> less ambiguous. Create a section in
    the metadata</p>
    <pre>
[env=WORLD]
</pre>

    <p>Add a title and description:</p>
    <pre>
[env=WORLD]
description = Choose your target world to say hello to.
title = World
</pre>

    <p>If you close and open the config editor again, (or switch the metadata
    off and on), you'll see that <var>WORLD</var> now has some helpful
    hover-over text when you move the mouse over the title.</p>

    <p>We'll decide to be harsh about grammar and insist that the first letter
    of <var>WORLD</var> be capitalised. To do this, we can use a very simple
    regular expression by adding a pattern:</p>
    <pre>
[env=WORLD]
description = Choose your target world to say hello to.
pattern = ^[A-Z]
title = World
</pre>

    <p>If you change the first letter of the value of <var>WORLD</var> to
    lowercase, an error will be flagged - you can change it back to fix it.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, we could just give a list of valid world names - this
    means we won't need a regular expression or any other type information.
    Let's remove the pattern and add a list of values:</p>
    <pre>
[env=WORLD]
description = Choose your target world to say hello to.
title = World
values = Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
</pre>

    <p>(You may add or remove <samp>Pluto</samp> in line with your personal
    preferences.)</p>

    <p>Now when you open the application in the config editor, you'll get a
    drop-down list of worlds to choose from. Isn't that nice! Rose will now
    check <var>WORLD</var> in the future to make sure its value is in this
    list.</p>

    <p>Looking at the other variable in the configuration, it doesn't appear as
    if we really need a Jupiter language <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> set when
    <var>WORLD</var> is not <samp>Jupiter</samp>. Let's add a trigger to
    automatically handle this:</p>
    <pre>
[env=WORLD]
description = Choose your target world to say hello to.
title = World
trigger = env=LANG_JUPITER: Jupiter
values = Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

[env=LANG_JUPITER]
</pre>

    <p>This means that <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> will be <em>ignored</em> when
    <var>WORLD</var> is not <samp>Jupiter</samp> - but it will be
    <em>enabled</em> when it is. Ignored variables won't get passed into our
    hello.exe application.</p>

    <p>Set <var>WORLD</var> to <samp>Jupiter</samp> and either save and reopen
    the config editor, or just switch metadata off and on.</p>

    <p>Now when you change the value of <var>WORLD</var> to
    <samp>Saturn</samp>, or any other planet, <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> will be
    <em>ignored</em> and hidden by default in the config editor (you can show
    it by selecting <code>View</code> Menu -&gt; View Ignored variables). If
    you change it back to <samp>Jupiter</samp>, it will be <em>enabled</em> and
    re-appear. When you've done that, change it to <samp>Earth</samp> and
    save.</p>

    <p>You can experiment with adding metadata to <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> if
    you wish.</p>

    <p>An important advantage of adding metadata is that it acts as a memory of
    inputs. If you remove <var>WORLD</var> (in a text editor or using the
    little button next to the title in the config editor) and save, any
    information about the variable <var>WORLD</var> is lost from your physical
    copy of the application. Close the config editor and check the application
    file.</p>

    <p>If you then re-open the <var>WORLD</var>-less application in the config
    editor, you can navigate to the <code>env</code> page and see that it's
    missing.</p>

    <p>If you select <code>View</code> Menu -&gt; View Latent variables, any
    variables that are in the metadata but aren't in the application will be
    displayed - <var>WORLD</var> will reappear as a ghost! You can add the
    variable back into the application by clicking on the button next to the
    name and selecting <samp>Add</samp>. It will be added with a 'best guess'
    value based on the metadata, which in this case will be
    <samp>Mercury</samp>.</p>

    <p>Let's add some proper help for <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> - Jovian
    linguistics are notoriously difficult. Add:</p>
    <pre>
[env=LANG_JUPITER]
help = This variable controls which language to use when saying hello
     = to Jupiter.
     =
     = The Galilean moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
     =
     = The Great Red Spot people are not worth it.
</pre>

    <p>If you open the application in the config editor, or switch metadata off
    and on, you can now click on the title of <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> or use
    the menu button to launch a help dialog.</p>

    <p>Let's improve the look of the <code>page</code> by adding metadata for
    the section:</p>
    <pre>
[env]
description = Hello Environment
help = These environment variables provide overrides for the hello.f90 program.
     =
     = Use these to say hello to other planets.
title = Environment
</pre>

    <p>On reload of the config editor, this gives a hover-over text
    (description) when the mouse is over the page name, and a menu option for
    help for this section (right click on the page name).</p>

    <p>We can also swap variables in and out of pages, regardless of whether
    they belong in the <code>env</code> application section or not. Let's move
    <var>LANG_JUPITER</var>. Add a namespace (ns):</p>
    <pre>
[env=LANG_JUPITER]
help = This variable controls which language to use when saying hello
     = to Jupiter.
     =
     = The Galilean moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
     =
     = The Great Red Spot people are not worth it.
ns = languages
</pre>

    <p>A reload of the config editor will show that <var>LANG_JUPITER</var> has
    been moved to a different page called languages. This can be useful for
    moving environment variables to their relevant namelists, or breaking up
    large namelists into several sections.</p>

    <p>Sometimes just having help or descriptions isn't enough, or there's a
    more relevant resource page on the Web - in this case you can add a url
    help:</p>
    <pre>
[env=LANG_JUPITER]
help = This variable controls which language to use when saying hello
     = to Jupiter.
     =
     = The Galilean moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
     =
     = The Great Red Spot people are not worth it.
ns = languages
url = http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter
</pre>

    <p>This can be accessed via the variable button menu (<var>Web Help</var>)
    in the config editor on reload, or via clicking on the variable name when
    there's no help.</p>

    <p>We've finished! However, there are other things you can do with
    configuration metadata. Make sure you have a good idea of when to use these
    by consulting the <a href="rose-configuration.html#meta">Rose Reference Guide
    &gt; Configuration Metadata</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="upgrade">Upgrade Macro Development</h2>

    <p>Upgrade macros automate the process of updating configurations from one
    version to the next, such as removing redundant settings or adding new
    ones.</p>
