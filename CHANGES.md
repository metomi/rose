# Rose Changes

## Rose 2012-11+ (To be released 2013-Q1)

### Highlight Changes

Changes that have significant impact on user experience.

\#244: Tutorial: Added S5 slide show enabled documentation chapters.
* Improved brief tour of the system.
* Metadata tutorial.
* Suite writing tutorial.
* In depth topics.
* Advanced tutorials.

\#165, #243: rose suite-run: run modes and new log directory mechanism:
* Log directories no longer rotated.
* Introduce a run mode: `--run=reload|restart|run`.
  In reload and restart modes, the existing log directory is used.
  For the normal run mode, it creates a new log and carries out housekeeping.
* It creates a `log.DATETIME` directory (where `DATETIME` is the current date
  time in ISO8601 format), and creates a symbolic link log to point to it. If
  `--log-name=NAME` is specified, it creates another symbolic link `log.NAME`
  to point to it as well.
* Old `log.DATETIME` directories are normally archived into tar-gzip files. The
  `--no-log-archive` option switches off this behaviour. `log.DATETIME`
  directories with named `log.NAME` symbolic links will not be archived.
* If `--log-keep=DAYS` is specified, `log.DATETIME` directories with modified
  time older than the specified number of `DAYS` are removed.
