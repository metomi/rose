  redundant.
* Rose will now use the suite contact file to determine whether a suite is
  running or not.
* rose suite-gcontrol --all: will now launch `cylc gscan` (instead of launching
  many `cylc gui` which can cause a machine to run out of resource if the user
  is running a large number of suites).
* rose suite-scan: will now invoke `cylc scan` directly.
* On launching a suite, `rose suite-run` will now write (Rose) automatic and
  custom environment variables to head of `suite.rc`.

  useful for site portable suites.

Rose Configuration Metadata: improve handling of environment variable
substitution in quoted string types.

### Other Changes

Rose Bush is being rebranded *Cylc Review* under the Cylc project. We have not
yet removed Rose Bush logic from the Rose project, but it will no longer be
maintained. We encourage sites and users to migrate to *Cylc Review* soon.

Lots of improvements and fixes to documentation.

Launch programs with `python2` instead of `python`.
