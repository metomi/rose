Usage:
    get-observations

Environment Variables:
    SITE_ID: The four digit DataPoint site code identifying the weather station
        we are to fetch results for.
    API_KEY: The DataPoint API key, required for getting live weather data.
        If un-specified then get-observations will fall back to archive data
        from the workflow directory.
