Broadcast
=========

This tutorial walks you through using ``cylc broadcast`` which can be used
to change :ref:`task runtime configuration <tutorial-runtime>` in a
running suite, on-the-fly.


Purpose
-------

``cylc broadcast`` can be used to change any ``[runtime]`` setting whilst the
suite is running.

The standard use of ``cylc broadcast`` is to update the suite to an
unexpected change in configuration, for example modifying the host a task
runs on.


Standalone Example
------------------

Create a new suite in the ``cylc-run`` directory called
``tutorial-broadcast``::

   mkdir ~/cylc-run/tutorial-broadcast
   cd ~/cylc-run/tutorial-broadcast

Copy the following configuration into a ``suite.rc`` file:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduling]
       initial cycle point = 1012
       [[dependencies]]
           [[[R1]]]
               graph = wipe_log => announce
           [[[PT1H]]]
               graph = announce[-PT1H] => announce

   [runtime]
       [[wipe_log]]
           # Delete any files in the suite's "share" directory.
           script = rm "${CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR}/knights" || true

       [[announce]]
           script = echo "${CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT} - ${MESSAGE}" >> "${FILE}"
           [[[environment]]]
               WORD = ni
               MESSAGE = We are the knights who say \"${WORD}\"!
               FILE = "${CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR}/knights"

We now have a suite with an ``announce`` task which runs every hour, writing a
message to a log file (``share/knights``) when it does so. For the first cycle
the log entry will look like this::

   10120101T0000Z - We are the knights who say "ni"!

The ``cylc broadcast`` command enables us to change runtime configuration
whilst the suite is running. For instance we could change the value of the
``WORD`` environment variable using the command::

   cylc broadcast tutorial-broadcast -n announce -s "[environment]WORD=it"

* ``tutorial-broadcast`` is the name of the suite.
* ``-n announce`` tells Cylc we want to change the runtime configuration of the
  ``announce`` task.
* ``-s "[environment]WORD=it"`` changes the value of the ``WORD`` environment
  variable to ``it``.

Run the suite then try using the ``cylc broadcast`` command to change the
message::

   cylc run tutorial-broadcast
   cylc broadcast tutorial-broadcast -n announce -s "[environment]WORD=it"

Inspect the ``share/knights`` file, you should see the message change at
certain points.

Stop the suite::

   cylc stop tutorial-broadcast


In-Situ Example
---------------

We can call ``cylc broadcast`` from within a task's script. This effectively
provides the ability for tasks to communicate between themselves.

It is almost always better for tasks to communicate using files but there are
some niche situations where comminicating via ``cylc broadcast`` is justified.
This tutorial walks you through using ``cylc broadcast`` to communicate between
tasks.

.. TODO - examples of this?

Add the following recurrence to the ``dependencies`` section:

.. code-block:: cylc

           [[[PT3H]]]
               graph = announce[-PT1H] => change_word => announce

The ``change_word`` task runs the ``cylc broadcast`` command to randomly
change the ``WORD`` environment variable used by the ``announce`` task.

Add the following runtime configuration to the ``runtime`` section:

.. code-block:: cylc

       [[change_word]]
           script = """
               # Select random word.
               IFS=',' read -r -a WORDS <<< $WORDS
               WORD=${WORDS[$(date +%s) % ${#WORDS[@]}]}

               # Broadcast random word to the announce task.
               cylc broadcast $CYLC_SUITE_NAME -n announce -s "[environment]WORD=${WORD}"
           """
           [[[environment]]]
               WORDS = ni, it, ekke ekke ptang zoo boing

Run the suite and inspect the log. You should see the message change randomly
after every third entry (because the ``change_word`` task runs every 3 hours)
e.g::

   10120101T0000Z - We are the knights who say "ni"!
   10120101T0100Z - We are the knights who say "ni"!
   10120101T0200Z - We are the knights who say "ni"!
   10120101T0300Z - We are the knights who say "ekke ekke ptang zoo boing!"

Stop the suite::

   cylc stop tutorial-broadcast
