Date-Time Cycling
=================


In the last section we looked at writing an :term:`integer cycling` workflow,
one where the :term:`cycle points <cycle point>` are numbered.

.. ifnotslides::

   Typically workflows are repeated at a regular time interval, say every day
   or every few hours. To make this easier Cylc has a date-time cycling mode
   where the :term:`cycle points <cycle point>` use date and time specifications
   rather than numbers.

.. admonition:: Reminder
   :class: tip

   :term:`Cycle points <cycle point>` are labels. Cylc runs tasks as soon as
   their dependencies are met so cycles do not necessarily run in order.


.. _tutorial-iso8601:

ISO8601
-------

In Cylc, dates, times and durations are written using the :term:`ISO8601` format
- an international standard for representing dates and times.

.. _tutorial-iso8601-datetimes:

Date-Times
^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   In ISO8601, datetimes are written from the largest unit to the smallest
   (i.e: year, month, day, hour, minute, second in succession) with the ``T``
   character separating the date and time components. For example, midnight
   on the 1st of January 2000 is written ``20000101T000000``.

   For brevity we may omit seconds (and minutes) from the time i.e:
   ``20000101T0000`` (``20000101T00``).

   For readability we may add hyphen (``-``) characters between the date
   components and colon (``:``) characters between the time components, i.e:
   ``2000-01-01T00:00``. This is the "extended" format.

   Time-zone information can be added onto the end. UTC is written ``Z``,
   UTC+1 is written ``+01``, etc. E.G: ``2000-01-01T00:00Z``.

   \underbrace{\huge \text{Z}}_{_{\text{Time Zone}}}
   }^{\text{Time Components}}}

.. nextslide::

.. warning::

   The "basic" (purely numeric except for ``T``) and "extended" (written with
   hyphens and colons) formats cannot be mixed. For example the following
   date-times are invalid:

   .. code-block:: none

      2000-01-01T0000
      20000101T00:00

.. _tutorial-iso8601-durations:

Durations
^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   In ISO8601, durations are prefixed with a ``P`` and are written with a
   character following each unit:

* ``Y`` for year.
* ``M`` for month.
* ``D`` for day.
* ``W`` for week.
* ``H`` for hour.
* ``M`` for minute.
* ``S`` for second.

.. nextslide::

.. ifnotslides::

   As with datetimes the components are written in order from largest to
   smallest and the date and time components are separated by the ``T``
   character. E.G:

* ``P1D``: one day.
* ``PT1H``: one hour.
* ``P1DT1H``: one day and one hour.
* ``PT1H30M``: one and a half hours.
* ``P1Y1M1DT1H1M1S``: a year and a month and a day and an hour and a
  minute and a second.


Date-Time Recurrences
---------------------

In :term:`integer cycling`, suites' recurrences are written ``P1``, ``P2``,
etc.

In :term:`date-time cycling <datetime cycling>` there are two ways to write
recurrences:

1. Using ISO8601 durations (e.g. ``P1D``, ``PT1H``).
2. Using ISO8601 date-times with inferred recurrence.

Inferred Recurrence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   A recurrence can be inferred from a date-time by omitting digits from the
   front. For example, if the year is omitted then the recurrence can be
   inferred to be annual. E.G:

* ``01-01T00``: every year on the 1st of January.
* ``01T00``: every month on the first of the month.
* ``T00``: every day at midnight.
* ``T-00``: every hour at zero minutes past (every hour on the hour).
  *Note that the* ``-`` *character takes the place of the hour digits*
  *as we may not omit components after the* ``T`` *character.*

Recurrence Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   As with integer cycling, recurrences start, by default, at the
   :term:`initial cycle point`. We can override this in one of two ways:

1. By defining an arbitrary cycle point (``datetime/recurrence``):

   * ``2000/P1Y``: every year starting with the year 2000.
   * ``2000-01-01T00/T00``: every day at midnight starting on the 1st of January
     2000
   * ``2000-01-01T12/T00``: every day at midnight starting on the first midnight
     after the 1st of January at 12:00 (i.e. ``2000-01-02T00``).

.. nextslide::

.. _tutorial-cylc-datetime-offset-icp:

2. By defining an offset from the initial cycle point (``offset/recurrence``).
   This offset is an ISO8601 duration preceded by a plus character:

   * ``+P1Y/P1Y``: every year starting one year after the initial cycle point.
   * ``+PT1H/T00``: every day starting on the first midnight after the point one
     hour after the initial cycle point.

.. nextslide::

.. warning::

   When using durations, beware that a change in the initial cycle point
   might produce different results for the recurrences.

   For example if you set the initial cycle point to ``2000-01-01T00`` the
   recurrence ``P1D`` would yield:

   ``2000-01-01T00``, ``2000-01-02T00``, ``2000-01-03T00``, ...

   If, however, the initial cycle point was changed from midnight to midday
   (``2000-01-01T12``), the same recurrence would instead yield:

   ``2000-01-01T12``, ``2000-01-02T12``, ``2000-01-03T12``, ...

   This can easily be adjusted. Both of the following recurrences induce a
   start on the first midnight *after* the initial cycle point.

   * ``T00/P1D``
   * ``T00``

The Initial & Final Cycle Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   There are two special recurrences for the initial and final cycle points:

* ``R1``: repeat once at the initial cycle point.
* ``R1/P0Y``: repeat once at the final cycle point.

.. TODO - change terminology as done in the cylc user guide, "repeat" can be
   confusing. Use occur?

Inter-Cycle Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   Inter-cycle dependencies are written as ISO8601 durations, e.g:

* ``foo[-P1D]``: the task ``foo`` from the cycle one day before.
* ``bar[-PT1H30M]``: the task ``bar`` from the cycle 1 hour 30 minutes before.

.. ifnotslides::

   The initial cycle point can be referenced using a caret character ``^``, e.g:

* ``baz[^]``: the task ``baz`` from the initial cycle point.


.. _tutorial-cylc-datetime-utc:

UTC Mode
--------

.. ifnotslides::

   Due to all of the difficulties caused by time zones, particularly with
   respect to daylight savings, we typically use UTC (that's the ``+00`` time
   zone) in Cylc suites.

   When a suite uses UTC all of the cycle points will be written in the
   ``+00`` time zone.

   To make your suite use UTC set the ``[cylc]UTC mode`` setting to ``True``,
   i.e:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [cylc]
       UTC mode = True


.. _tutorial-datetime-cycling-practical:

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

.. ifslides::

   We will now develop a simple weather forecasting suite.

.. ifnotslides::

   Cylc was originally developed for running operational weather forecasting. In
   this section we will outline a basic (dummy) weather-forecasting suite and
   explain how to implement it in cylc.

   .. note::

      Technically the suite outlined in this section is a `nowcasting`_ suite.
      We will refer to it as forecasting for simplicity.

   A basic weather-forecasting workflow consists of three main steps:

1. Gathering Observations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   We gather observations from different weather stations and use them to
   build a picture of the current weather. Our dummy weather forecast
   will get wind observations from four weather stations:

   * Belmullet
   * Camborne
   * Heathrow
   * Shetland

   The tasks which retrieve observation data will be called
   ``get_observations_<site>`` where ``site`` is the name of the weather
   station in question.

   Next we need to consolidate these observations so that our forecasting
   system can work with them. To do this we have a
   ``consolidate_observations`` task.

   We will fetch wind observations **every three hours starting from the initial
   cycle point**.

   The ``consolidate_observations`` task must run after the
   ``get_observations<site>`` tasks.

.. digraph:: example
   :align: center

   size = "7,4"

   get_observations_belmullet -> consolidate_observations
   get_observations_camborne -> consolidate_observations
   get_observations_heathrow -> consolidate_observations
   get_observations_shetland -> consolidate_observations

   hidden [style="invis"]
   get_observations_belmullet -> hidden [style="invis"]
   get_observations_camborne -> hidden [style="invis"]
   hidden -> consolidate_observations [style="invis"]

.. ifnotslides::

   We will also use the UK radar network to get rainfall data with a task
   called ``get_rainfall``.

   We will fetch rainfall data **every six hours starting six hours after the
   initial cycle point**.

2. Running computer models to generate forecast data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   We will do this with a task called ``forecast`` which will run
   **every six hours starting six hours after the initial cycle point**.
   The ``forecast`` task will be dependent on:

   * The ``consolidate_observations`` task from the previous two cycles as well
     as from the present cycle.
   * The ``get_rainfall`` task from the present cycle.

.. digraph:: example
   :align: center

   size = "7,4"

   subgraph cluster_T00 {
       label="+PT0H"
       style="dashed"
       "observations.t00" [label="consolidate observations\n+PT0H"]
   }

   subgraph cluster_T03 {
       label="+PT3H"
       style="dashed"
       "observations.t03" [label="consolidate observations\n+PT3H"]
   }

   subgraph cluster_T06 {
       label="+PT6H"
       style="dashed"
       "forecast.t06" [label="forecast\n+PT6H"]
       "get_rainfall.t06" [label="get_rainfall\n+PT6H"]
       "observations.t06" [label="consolidate observations\n+PT6H"]
   }

   "observations.t00" -> "forecast.t06"
   "observations.t03" -> "forecast.t06"
   "observations.t06" -> "forecast.t06"
   "get_rainfall.t06" -> "forecast.t06"

3. Processing the data output to produce user-friendly forecasts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. ifnotslides::

   This will be done with a task called ``post_process_<location>`` where
   ``location`` is the place we want to generate the forecast for. For
   the moment we will use Exeter.

   The ``post_process_exeter`` task will run **every six hours starting six
   hours after the initial cycle point** and will be dependent on the
   ``forecast`` task.

.. digraph:: example
   :align: center

   size = "2.5,2"

   "forecast" -> "post_process_exeter"

.. nextslide::

.. ifslides::

   .. rubric:: Next Steps

   1. Read through the "Putting It All Together" section.
   2. Complete the practical.

   Next section: :ref:`tutorial-cylc-further-scheduling`


.. practical::

   .. rubric:: In this practical we will create a dummy forecasting suite
      using date-time cycling.

   #. **Create A New Suite.**

      Within your ``~/cylc-run`` directory create a new directory called
      ``datetime-cycling`` and move into it:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir ~/cylc-run/datetime-cycling
         cd ~/cylc-run/datetime-cycling

       Create a ``suite.rc`` file and paste the following code into it:

      .. code-block:: cylc

         [cylc]
             UTC mode = True
         [scheduling]
             initial cycle point = 20000101T00Z
             [[dependencies]]

   #. **Add The Recurrences.**

      The weather-forecasting suite will require two
      recurrences. Add sections under the dependencies section for these,
      based on the information given above.

      .. hint::

         See :ref:`Date-Time Recurrences<tutorial-cylc-datetime-offset-icp>`.

      .. spoiler:: Solution warning

         The two recurrences you need are

         * ``PT3H``: repeat every three hours starting from the initial cycle
           point.
         * ``+PT6H/PT6H``: repeat every six hours starting six hours after the
           initial cycle point.

         .. code-block:: diff

             [cylc]
                 UTC mode = True
             [scheduling]
                 initial cycle point = 20000101T00Z
                 [[dependencies]]
            +        [[[PT3H]]]
            +        [[[+PT6H/PT6H]]]

   #. **Write The Graphing.**

      With the help of the graphs and the information above add dependencies to
      your suite to implement the weather-forecasting workflow.

      You will need to consider the inter-cycle dependencies between tasks.

      Use ``cylc graph`` to inspect your work.

      .. spoiler:: Hint hint

         The dependencies you will need to formulate are as follows:

         * The ``consolidate_observations`` task is dependent on the
           ``get_observations_<site>`` tasks.
         * The ``forecast`` task is dependent on:

           * the ``get_rainfall`` task;
           * the ``consolidate_observations`` tasks from:

             * the same cycle;
             * the cycle 3 hours before (``-PT3H``);
             * the cycle 6 hours before (``-PT6H``).

         * The ``post_process_exeter`` task is dependent on the ``forecast``
           task.

         To launch ``cylc graph`` run the command:

         .. code-block:: sub

            cylc graph <path/to/suite.rc>

      .. spoiler:: Solution warning

         .. code-block:: cylc

           [cylc]
               UTC mode = True
           [scheduling]
               initial cycle point = 20000101T00Z
               [[dependencies]]
                   [[[PT3H]]]
                       graph = """
                           get_observations_belmullet => consolidate_observations
                           get_observations_camborne => consolidate_observations
                           get_observations_heathrow => consolidate_observations
                           get_observations_shetland => consolidate_observations
                       """
                   [[[+PT6H/PT6H]]]
                       graph = """
                           consolidate_observations => forecast
                           consolidate_observations[-PT3H] => forecast
                           consolidate_observations[-PT6H] => forecast
                           get_rainfall => forecast => post_process_exeter
                       """

   #. **Inter-Cycle Offsets.**

      To ensure the ``forecast`` tasks for different cycles run in order the
      ``forecast`` task will also need to be dependent on the previous run
      of ``forecast``.

      .. digraph:: example
         :align: center

         size = "4,1.5"
         rankdir=LR

         subgraph cluster_T06 {
             label="T06"
             style="dashed"
             "forecast.t06" [label="forecast\nT06"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_T12 {
             label="T12"
             style="dashed"
             "forecast.t12" [label="forecast\nT12"]
         }

         subgraph cluster_T18 {
             label="T18"
             style="dashed"
             "forecast.t18" [label="forecast\nT18"]
         }

         "forecast.t06" -> "forecast.t12" -> "forecast.t18"

      We can express this dependency as ``forecast[-PT6H] => forecast``.

      Try adding this line to your suite then visualising it with ``cylc
      graph``.

      You will notice that there is a dependency which looks like this:

      .. digraph:: example
        :align: center

         size = "4,1"
         rankdir=LR

         "forecast.t00" [label="forecast\n20000101T0000Z"
                         color="#888888"
                         fontcolor="#888888"]
         "forecast.t06" [label="forecast\n20000101T0600Z"]


         "forecast.t00" -> "forecast.t06"

      Note in particular that the ``forecast`` task in the 00:00 cycle is
      grey. The reason for this is that this task does not exist. Remember
      the forecast task runs every six hours
      **starting 6 hours after the initial cycle point**, so the
      dependency is only valid from 12:00 onwards. To fix the problem we
      must add a new dependency section which repeats every six hours
      **starting 12 hours after the initial cycle point**.

      Make the following changes to your suite and the grey task should
      disappear:

      .. code-block:: diff

                    [[[+PT6H/PT6H]]]
                        graph = """
