``rose_ana``
============

This built-in application runs the ``rose-ana`` analysis engine.

``rose-ana`` performs various configurable analysis steps. For example
a common usage is to compare two files and report whether they differ
or not. It can write the details of any comparisons it runs to a
database in the suite's log directory to assist with any automated
updating of control data.


Invocation
----------

In automatic selection mode, this built-in application will be
invoked automatically if a task has a name that starts with ``rose_ana*``.


Analysis Modules
----------------

The built-in application will search for suitable analysis modules to
load firstly in the ``ana`` subdirectory of the ``rose-ana`` app, then in
the ``ana`` subdirectory of the top-most suite directory. Any
additional directories to search (for example a site-wide central
directory) may be specified by setting the
:rose:conf:`rose.conf[rose-ana]method-path` variable. Finally the
``ana_builtins`` subdirectory of the Rose installation itself contains
any built-in comparisons.


Configuration
-------------

The application configuration should contain configuration sections which
describe an analysis step. These sections must follow a particular format:

* the name must begin with ``ana:``. This is required for ``rose-ana`` to
  recognise it as a valid section.
* the next part gives the name of the class within one of the analysis
  modules, including namespace information; for example to use the built-in
  ``FilePattern`` class from the ``grepper`` module you would provide the
  name ``grepper.FilePattern``.
* finally an expression within parentheses which may contain any string;
  this should be used to make comparisons using the same class unique, but
  can otherwise simply act as a description or note.

The content within each of these sections consists of a series of key-value
option pairs, just like other standard Rose apps. However the availability
of options for a given section is specified and controlled by the *class*
rather than the meta-data. This makes it easy to provide your own analysis
modules without requiring changes to Rose itself.

Therefore you should consult the documentation or source code of the
analysis module you wish to use for details of which options it supports.
Additionally, some special treatment is applied to all options depending
on what they contain:

Environment Variables
   If the option contains any words prefixed by ``$``
   they will be substituted for the equivalent environment variable, if one
   is available.
Lists
   If the option contains newlines it will be returned as a list of
   strings automatically.
Argument substitution
   If the option contains one or more pairs of braces (``{}``) the option
   will be returned multiple times with the parentheses substituted once for
   each argument passed to :ref:`command-rose-task-run`

The app may also define a configuration section, ``[ana:config]``, whose
key-value pairs define app-wide settings that are passed through to the
analysis classes. In the same way that the task options are dependent on
the class definition, interpretation of the ``config`` options is done by the
class(es), so their documentation or source code should be consulted for
details.

.. rose:app:: rose_ana

   .. rose:conf:: ana:config

      .. rose:conf:: grepper-report-limit

         Limits the number of lines printed when using the
         :py:mod:`rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper` analysis class.

      .. rose:conf:: skip-if-all-files-missing

         Causes the :py:mod:`rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper` class to pass
         if all files to be compared are missing.

      .. rose:conf:: kgo-database

         Turns on the :ref:`Rose Ana Comparison Database
         <The Rose Ana Comparison Database>`.

   .. rose:conf:: ana:ANALYSIS_CLASS

      Define a new analysis step. ``ANALYSIS_CLASS`` is the name of 
      the analysis class e.g. ``grepper.FilePattern``.

      .. rose:conf:: KEY=VALUE

         Define an argument to ``ANALYSIS_CLASS``.


Analysis Classes
----------------

There is one built-in module of analysis classes called ``grepper``.

.. To document everything:

   .. automodule:: rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper
      :members:

.. autoclass:: rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper.FileCommandPattern

.. autoclass:: rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper.FilePattern

.. autoclass:: rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper.SingleCommandPattern

.. autoclass:: rose.apps.ana_builtin.grepper.SingleCommandStatus
