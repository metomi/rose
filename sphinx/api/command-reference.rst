.. _command-rose-test-battery:

etc/bin/rose-test-battery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ROSE_DEVELOPER_DIR/etc/bin/rose-test-battery

Run Rose self tests.

n.b. This will only work where a developer has downloaded and installed
their own copy of Rose using pip install -e .

Change directory to Rose source tree, and runs this shell command:

``exec prove -j "$NPROC" -s -r "${@:-t}"``

where ``NPROC`` is the number of processors on your computer (or the
setting ``[t]prove-options`` in the site/user configuration file). If you
do not want to run the full test suite, you can specify the names of
individual test files or their containing directories as extra arguments.

**EXAMPLES**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run the full test suite with the default options.
   rose test-battery
   # Run the full test suite with 12 processes.
   rose test-battery -j 12
   # Run only tests under "t/rose-app-run/" with 12 processes.
   rose test-battery -j 12 t/rose-app-run
   # Run only "t/rose-app-run/07-opt.t" in verbose mode.
   rose test-battery -v t/rose-app-run/07-opt.t
