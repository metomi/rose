Installation
============

Rose runs on Unix-like systems including Linux and MacOS.

Quick Installation
------------------

With ``conda`` (recommended)::

   $ conda install metomi-rose

With ``pip`` (you will need to ensure `Non Python Dependencies`_ are met)::

   $ pip install metomi-rose

Installing With Cylc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rose does not require and is distributed independently of `Cylc`_.

To use Rose with Cylc you will need to install `Cylc Flow`_ and `Cylc Rose`_
into the same Python environment as Rose.

With ``conda`` (recommended)::

   $ conda install cylc-flow cylc-rose

With ``pip`` (you will need to ensure `Non Python Dependencies`_ are met)::

   $ pip install cylc-flow cylc-rose

.. note::

   `Cylc`_ is a distributed system, not all dependencies are required on all
   platforms.

   See the `Cylc`_ installation instructions for more information.

   .. TODO

      This reference will pass once intersphinx has a more contemporary
      version of cylc-doc to point at (see conf.py)

      See the :ref:`Cylc installation instructions <cylc:installation>` for more
      information.

Non Python Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following packages are installed by ``conda`` but not by ``pip``:

* FCM
* Perl
* Python3
* Subversion

If installing via ``pip`` run :ref:`command-rose-check-software` to ensure
non-Python dependencies are satisfied.

.. note::

   Subversion & FCM are required for installing files from Subversion using FCM
   keywords by:

   + ``rose app-run``
   + ``rose task-run``
   + ``cylc install``

   Git is likewise required for installing files from Git repositories or
   hosting services such as GitHub. Note Git is not automatically installed
   by the metomi-rose conda.

Configuring Rose
----------------

Rose configuration files can be located in the following places:

* ``/etc/.metomi/rose.conf``
* ``$ROSE_SITE_CONF_PATH/.metomi/rose.conf``
* ``$HOME/.metomi/rose.conf``

See :rose:file:`rose.conf` in the API reference for more information.


Configuring Rosie Client
------------------------

Rosie is an optional suite storage and discovery system.

Rosie stores suites using Subversion repositories, with databases behind
a web interface for suite discovery and lookup.

If users at your site are able to access Rosie services on the Internet
or if someone else has already configured Rosie services at your site,
all you need to do is configure the client to talk to the servers.

Refer to the `Configuring a Rosie Server`_ section if you need to
configure a Rosie server for your site.

To set up the Rosie client for the site, add/modify the
:rose:conf:`rose.conf[rosie-id]` E.g.:

.. code-block:: rose

   [rosie-id]
   prefix-default=x
   prefixes-ws-default=x myorg

   prefix-location.x=https://somehost.on.the.internet/svn/roses-x
   prefix-web.x=https://somehost.on.the.internet/trac/roses-x/intertrac/source:
   prefix-ws.x=https://somehost.on.the.internet/rosie/x

   prefix-location.myorg=svn://myhost.myorg/roses-myorg
   prefix-web.myorg=http://myhost.myorg/trac/roses-myorg/intertrac/source:
   prefix-ws.myorg=http://myhost.myorg/rosie/myorg

Check the following:

1. You can access the Rosie Subversion repository without being prompted
   for a username and a password. This may require configuring Subversion
   to cache your authentication information with a keyring.

   *(See Subversion Book > Advanced Topics > Network Model > Client
   Credentials for a discussion on how to do this.)*

2. The Rosie web service is up and running and you can access the Rosie
   web service from your computer. E.g. if the Rosie web service is
   hosted at ``https://somehost.on.the.internet/rosie/x``, you can check
   that you have access by typing the following on the command line::

      curl -I https://somehost.on.the.internet/rosie/x

   It should return a HTTP code 200. If you are prompted for a username
   and a password, you may need to have access to a keyring to cache
   the authentication information.

3. You can access the Rosie web service using the Rosie client. E.g.
   using the above configuration for the prefix ``x``, type the
   following on the command line::

      rosie hello --prefix=x

   It should return a greeting, e.g. ``Hello user``.


Deploying Configuration Metadata
--------------------------------

You may want to deploy :ref:`conf-meta` for projects using Rose
in a globally readable location at your site, so that they can be
easily accessed by users when using Rose utilities such as
:ref:`command-rose-config-edit` or :ref:`command-rose-macro`.

If the source tree of a project is version controlled under a
trusted Subversion repository, it is possible to automatically deploy
their configuration metadata. Assuming that the projects follow our
recommendation and store Rose configuration metadata under the
``rose-meta/`` directory of their source tree, you can:

* Check out a working copy for each sub-directory under the
  ``rose-meta/`` directory.
* Set up a crontab job to regularly update the working copies.

For example, suppose you want to deploy Rose :ref:`Metadata`
under ``/etc/rose-meta/`` at your site. You can do::

   # Deployment location
   DEST='/etc/rose-meta'
   cd "${DEST}"

   # Assume only Rose metadata configuration directories under "rose-meta/"
   URL1='https://somehost/foo/main/trunk/rose-meta'
   URL2='https://anotherhost/bar/main/trunk/rose-meta'
   # ...

   # Checkout a working copy for each metadata configuration directory
   for URL in "${URL1}" "${URL2}"; do
     for NAME in $(svn ls "${URL}"); do
         svn checkout -q "${URL}/${NAME}"
     done
   done

   # Set up a crontab job to update the working copies, e.g. every 10 minutes
   crontab -l || true >'crontab.tmp'
   {
     echo '# Update Rose configuration metadata every 10 minutes'
     echo "*/10 * * * * svn update -q ${DEST}/*"
   } >>'crontab.tmp'
   crontab 'crontab.tmp'
   rm 'crontab.tmp'

   # Finally add the root level "meta-path" setting to site's "rose.conf"
   # E.g. if Rose is installed under "/opt/rose/":
   {
     echo '[]'
     echo "meta-path=${DEST}"
   } >>'/opt/rose/etc/rose.conf'

.. tip::
   See also :ref:`app-meta-loc`.


Configuring a Rosie Server
--------------------------

You should only need to configure and run your own Rosie service if you do
not have access to Rosie services on the Internet, or if you need a
private Rosie service for your site. Depending on settings at your
site, you may or may not be able to set up this service.

You will need to select a machine to host the Subversion repositories.
This machine will also host the web server and databases.

.. _Subversion FSFS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion#FSFS

Login to your host, create one or more `Subversion FSFS`_ repositories.

If you want to use FCM for your version control, you should set a
special property on the repository to allow branching and merging
with FCM in the Rosie convention. For example, if your repository
is served from ``HOST_AND_PATH`` (e.g. ``myhost001/svn-repos``) with
given repository base name ``NAME`` (e.g. ``roses_foo``), change into a
new directory and enter the following commands::

   svn co -q "svn://${HOST_AND_PATH}/${NAME}/"
   svn ps fcm:layout -F - "${NAME}" <<'__FCM_LAYOUT__'
   depth-project = 5
   depth-branch = 1
   depth-tag = 1
   dir-trunk = trunk
   dir-branch =
   dir-tag =
   level-owner-branch =
   level-owner-tag =
   template-branch =
   template-tag =
   __FCM_LAYOUT__
   svn ci -m 'fcm:layout: defined.' "${NAME}"
   rm -fr "${NAME}"

Add the following hook scripts to the repository:

* pre-commit:

  .. code-block:: sub

     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     exec <path-to-rose>/sbin/rosa svn-pre-commit "$@"

* post-commit:

  .. code-block:: sub

      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      exec <path-to-rose>/sbin/rosa svn-post-commit "$@"

You should replace ``<path-to-rose>`` with the location of your Rose
installation.

Make sure the hook scripts are executable.

The ``rosa svn-post-commit`` command in the ``post-commit`` hook is used
to populate a database with the suite discovery information as suites
are committed to the repository. Edit the :rose:conf:`rose.conf[rosie-db]`
settings to point to your host machine and provide relevant
paths such as the location for your repository and database.

Once you have done that, create the Rosie database by running:

.. code-block:: sub

   <path-to-rose>/sbin/rosa db-create

Make sure that the account that runs the repository hooks has read/write
access to the database and database directory.

You can test that everything is working using the built-in web server.
Edit the :rose:conf:`rose.conf[rosie-disco]` settings to configure
the web server's log directory and port number. Start the web server
by running:

.. code-block:: sub

   setsid <path-to-rose>/bin/rosie disco start 0</dev/null 1</dev/null 2>&1 &

Check that the server is up and running using ``curl`` or a local
web browser. E.g. If you have configured the server's port to be 1234,
you can do:

.. code-block:: sub

   curl -I http://localhost:1234/

It should return a HTTP code 200.

Alternatively you can run the Rosie web service under Apache ``mod_wsgi``.
To do this you will need to set up an Apache module configuration file
(typically in ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/rose-wsgi.conf``) containing the
following (with the paths set appropriately):

.. code-block:: sub

   WSGIPythonPath <path-to-rose>/lib/python
   WSGIScriptAlias /rosie <path-to-rose>/lib/python/rosie/ws.py

Use the Apache log at e.g. ``/var/log/httpd/`` to debug problems.

Hopefully, you should now have a working Rosie service server. Configure
the client settings by editing the :rose:conf:`rose.conf[rosie-id]`
settings. If you are using the built-in web server, you
should ensure that you include the port number in the URL. E.g.:

.. code-block:: rose

   [rosie-id]
   prefix-ws.foo=http://127.0.0.1:1234/foo

You should now be able to talk to the Rosie web service server via
the Rosie web service client. Test by doing::

   rosie hello

To test that everything is connecting together, create your first
suite in the repository by doing::

   rosie create

which will create the first suite in your repository, with an ID
ending in ``aa000`` - e.g. ``foo-aa000``. Locate it by running::

   rosie lookup 000

``ROSIE`` special suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define a special suite in each Rosie repository that provides
some additional repository-specific data and metadata. The suite
ID will end with ``ROSIE`` - e.g. ``foo-ROSIE``.

This can be created by running ``rosie create --meta-suite``.

Creating a Known Keys File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can extend the list of search keys used in the Rosie discovery
interfaces (such as ``rosie go``). Create a text file at the root
of a Rosie suite working copy called ``rosie-keys``.

Add a space-delimited list of search keys into the file - for example:

.. code-block:: none

   sub-project experiment model

Run ``fcm add -c`` and ``fcm commit``. After the commit, these will be
added to the list of Rosie interface search keys.

You can continue to modify the list by changing the file contents and
committing.
