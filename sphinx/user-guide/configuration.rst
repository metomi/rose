.. _rose-configuration:

Configuration
=============


Goals
-----

Suite configurations should be portable between users (at least at the same
site). E.g.: another user should be able to run the same suite:

* without making ANY changes to it.
* without having to add/modify things in their ``$HOME/.profile``.

Input configurations should be programming language neutral.

* Any processing logic should be application/version independent, generic and
  future proof.
* Data structure should be represented in formats easily understood and
  manipulatable by a human and a computer.

The life cycles of application configurations in a suite may differ from that
of the suite.

* The configuration of an application may be independent of the suite.
* The configuration of an application should be portable between suitable
  suites.

The configurations are independent of the utilities. For example, the
configuration metadata for the suite and application configurations will
drive the Rose config editor GUI, but will not be bound or restricted by it.


.. _conf-format:

Configuration Format
--------------------

A configuration in Rose is normally represented by a directory with the
following:

* a configuration file in a modified `INI`_ format.
* (optionally) files containing data that cannot easily be represented by the
  INI format.

We have added the following conventions into our INI format:

#. The file name is normally called ``rose*.conf``, e.g. ``rose.conf``,
   ``rose-app.conf``, ``rose-meta.conf``, etc.
#. Only a hash ``#`` in the beginning of a line starts a comment. Empty lines
   and lines with only white spaces are ignored. There is no support for
   trailing comments. Comments are normally ignored when a configuration file
   is loaded. However, some comments are loaded if the following conditions
   are met:

   * Comment lines at the beginning of a configuration file up to but not
     including the 1st blank line or the 1st setting are comment lines
     associated with the file. They will re-appear at the top of the file
     when it is re-dumped.
   * Comment lines between a blank line and the next setting, and the
     comment lines between the previous setting and the next setting are
     comments associated with the next setting. The comment lines associated
     with a setting will re-appear before the setting when the file is
     re-dumped.

#. Only the equal sign ``=`` is used to delimit a key-value pair - because the 
   colon ``:`` may be used in keys of namelist declarations.
#. A key-value pair declaration does not have to live under a section 
   declaration. Such a declaration lives directly under the *root* level.
#. Key-value pair declarations following a line with only ``[]`` are placed 
   directly under the root level.
#. Declarations are case sensitive. When dealing with case-insensitive
   inputs such as Fortran logicals or numbers in scientific notation,
   lowercase values should be used.
#. When writing namelist inputs, keys should be lowercase.
#. Declarations start at column 1. Continuations start at column >1.

   * Each line is stripped of leading and trailing spaces.
   * A newline ``\n`` character is prefixed to each continuation line.
   * If a continuation line has a leading equal sign ``=`` character, it is
     stripped from the line. This is useful for retaining leading white 
     spaces in a continuation line.

#. A single exclamation ``!`` or a double exclamation ``!!`` in front of a
   section (i.e. ``[!SECTION]``) or key=value pair (i.e. ``!key=value``)
   denotes an ignored setting.

   * E.g. It will be ignored in run time but may be used by other Rose
     utilities.
   * A single exclamation denotes a user-ignored setting.
   * A double exclamation denotes a program-ignored setting. E.g.
     ``rose config-edit`` may use a double exclamation to switch off a
     setting according to the setting metadata.

#. The open square bracket (``[``) and close square bracket (``]``) characters
   cannot be used within a section declaration. E.g.
   ``[[hello]``, ``[hello]]``, ``[hello [world] and beyond]`` should all be
   errors on parsing.
#. If a section is declared twice in a file, the later section will append
   settings to the earlier one. If the same key in the same section is
   declared twice, the later value will override the earlier one. This logic
   applies to the state of a setting as well.
#. Once the file is parsed, declaration ordering is insignificant.

   .. note::
      Do not assume order of environment variables.

#. Values of settings accept syntax such as ``$NAME`` or ``${NAME}`` for
   environment variable substitution.

E.g.

.. code-block:: rose

   # This is line 1 of the comment for this file.
   # This is line 2 of the comment for this file.

   # This comment will be ignored.

   # This is a comment for section-1.
   [section-1]
   # This is a comment for key-1.
   key-1=value 1
   # This comment will be ignored.

   # This is line 1 of the comment for key-2.
   # This is line 2 of the comment for key-2.
   key-2=value 2 line 1
         value 2 line 2
   # This is a comment for key-3.
   key-3=value 3 line 1
        =    value 3 line 2 has leading identation.
        =
        =    value 3 line 3 is blank. This is line 4.

   # section-2 is user-ignored.
   [!section-2]
   key-4=value 4
   # ...

   [section-3]
   # key-5 is program ignored.
   !!key-5=value 5

.. note::
   In this document, the shorthand ``SECTION=KEY=VALUE`` is used to represent a
   ``KEY=VALUE`` pair in a ``[SECTION]`` of an INI format file.

.. _opt-config:

Optional Configuration
----------------------

In a Rose configuration directory, we can add an ``opt/`` sub-directory for
optional configuration files. Optional configuration files contain additional
configuration, which can be selected at run time to override the configuration
in the main ``rose-${TYPE}.conf`` file. The name of each optional configuration
should follow the syntax ``rose-${TYPE}-${KEY}.conf``, where ``${KEY}`` is a
short name to describe the override functionality of the optional
configuration file.

A root level ``opts=KEY ...`` setting in the main configuration will tell the
run time program to load the relevant optional configurations in the ``opt/``
sub-directory at run time. Individual Rose utilities may also read optional
configuration keys from environment variables and/or command line options.

Where multiple ``$KEY`` settings are given, the optional configurations are 
applied in that order - for example, a setting:

.. code-block:: rose

   opts=ketchup mayonnaise

implies loading the optional configuration ``rose-app-ketchup.conf`` and then
the optional configuration ``rose-app-mayonnaise.conf``, which may override
the previous one.

By default, a Rose command will fail if an optional configuration file is
missing. However, if you put the optional configuration key in brackets,
then the optional configuration file is allowed to be missing. E.g.:

.. code-block:: rose

   opts=ketchup (mayonnaise)

In the above example, ``rose-app-mayonnaise.conf`` can be missing.

Some Rose utilities (e.g. :ref:`command-rose-suite-run`,
:ref:`command-rose-task-run`, :ref:`command-rose-app-run`, etc) allow
optional configurations to be selected at run time using:

#. The ``ROSE_APP_OPT_CONF_KEYS`` Environment variables.
#. The command line options ``--opt-conf-key=KEY`` or ``-O KEY``.

.. tip::
   See reference of individual commands for detail.

.. note::
   By default optional configurations must exist else an error will
   be raised. To specify an optional configuration which may be missing write
   the name of the configuration inside parenthesis (e.g. ``(foo)``).

Optional Configurations and Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata utilities such as ``rose app-upgrade`` and ``rose macro`` treat each
main + optional configuration as a separate entity to be transformed,
upgraded, or validated. Use cases with more than one optional configuration
are not handled.

When transforming or upgrading, each optional configuration is treated
separately and re-created after the transform as a functional difference
from the main upgraded configuration.

The logic for transforming or upgrading a main configuration ``C`` with
optional configurations ``O1`` and ``O2`` into a new main configuration ``Ct``
and new optional configurations ``O1t`` and ``O2t`` can be represented like
this:

.. code-block:: none

   C => Ct
   C + O1 => C1t
   C + O2 => C2t
   O1t = C1t - Ct
   O2t = C2t - Ct


Import Configuration
--------------------

A root level ``import=PATH1 PATH2...`` setting in the main configuration will
tell Rose utilities to search for configurations at ``PATH1``, ``PATH2`` (and
so on) and inherit configuration and files from them if found.

.. tip::
   At the moment, use of this is only encouraged for configuration metadata.


Re-define Configuration at Run Time
-----------------------------------

Some Rose utilities (e.g. :ref:`command-rose-suite-run`,
:ref:`command-rose-task-run`, :ref:`command-rose-app-run`, etc) allow you
to re-define configuration settings at run time using the
``--define=[SECTION]NAME=VALUE`` or ``-D [SECTION]NAME=VALUE`` options on
the command line. This would add new settings or override any settings
defined in the main and optional configurations. E.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Set [env]FOO=foo, and [env]BAR=bar
   # (Overriding any original settings of [env]FOO or [env]BAR)
   rose task-run -D '[env]FOO=foo' -D '[env]BAR=bar'

   # Switch off [env]BAZ
   rose task-run -D '[env]!BAZ='


.. _site-n-user-conf:

Site and User Configuration
---------------------------

Aspects of some Rose utilities can be configured per installation via the
site configuration file and per user via the user configuration file. Any
configuration in the site configuration overrides the default, and any
configuration in the user configuration overrides the site configuration and
the default. Rose expects these files to be in the modified INI format
described above. Rose utilities search for its site configuration at
``$ROSE_HOME/etc/rose.conf`` where ``$ROSE_HOME/bin/rose`` is the location of
the ``rose`` command, and they search for the user configuration at
``$HOME/.metomi/rose.conf`` where ``$HOME`` is the home directory of the
current user.

.. note::
   Allowed settings in the site and user configuration files will be
   documented in a future version of this document. In the mean time, the
   settings are documented as comments in the ``etc/rose.conf.example``
   file of each distribution of Rose.

You can also override many internal constants of the ``rose config edit`` and
``rosie go``. To change the keyboard shortcut of the ``Find Next`` action in
the config editor to ``F3``, put the following lines in your user config file,
and the setting will apply the next time you run ``rose config-edit``:

.. code-block:: rose

   [rose-config-edit]
   accel-find-next=F3


Suite Configuration
-------------------

The configuration and functionality of a suite will usually be covered by
the use of `cylc`_. In which case, most of the suite configuration will live
in the cylc ``suite.rc`` file. Otherwise, a suite is just a directory of
files.

A suite directory may contain the following:

* A file called ``rose-suite.conf``, a configuration file in the modified INI
  format described above. It stores the information on how to install the
  suite. See :ref:`below <suite-config-suite-inst>` for detail.
* A file called ``rose-suite.info``, a configuration file in the modified INI
  format described above. It describes the suite's purpose and identity, e.g.
  the title, the description, the owner, the access control list, and other
  information. Apart from a few standard fields, a suite is free to store
  any information in this file. See :ref:`below <suite-config-suite-info>`
  for detail.
* An ``app/`` directory of application configurations used by the suite.
* A ``bin/`` directory of scripts and utilities used by the suite.
* An ``etc/`` directory of other configurations and resources used the suite.
  E.g. fcm make configurations.
* A ``meta/`` directory containing the suite's configuration metadata.
* ``opt/`` directory. For detail, see :ref:`opt-config`.
* Other items, as long as they do not clash with the scheduler's working
  directories. E.g. for a cylc suite, ``log*/``, ``share/``, ``state/`` and
  ``work/`` should be avoided.

.. _suite-config-suite-inst:

Suite Configuration: Suite Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The suite install configuration file ``rose-suite.conf`` should contain the
information on how to install the suite. It may have the following sections
and root level options:

``[env]``
  Specify the environment variables to export to the suite daemon. The
  usual ``$NAME`` or ``${NAME}`` syntax can be used in values to reference
  environment variables that are already defined before the suite runner is
  invoked. However, it is unsafe to reference other environment variables
  defined in this section. If the value of an environment variable setting
  begins with a  tilde ``~``, all of the characters preceding the 1st slash
  ``/`` are considered a *tilde-prefix*. Where possible, a tilde-prefix is
  replaced with the home  directory associated with the specified login name
  at run time. There are 2  special environment variables which can be
  specified in this section:

  * ``ROSE_VERSION``: If specified, the version of Rose that starts the suite
    run must match the specified version.
  * ``CYLC_VERSION``: If specified for a cylc suite, the Rose suite runner
    will attempt to use this version of cylc.

``[jinja2:suite.rc]``
  For a cylc suite, if `Jinja2`_ assignments are required for
  ``suite.rc``, they may be defined as ``key=value`` pairs in the
  ``[jinja2:suite.rc]`` section. The assignments will be inserted after the
  ``#!jinja2`` line of the installed ``suite.rc`` file.

``[file:NAME]``
  Specify a file/directory to be installed. ``NAME`` should be a path
  relative to the run time ``$PWD``.

  * E.g. ``file:app/APP=source=LOCATION``.
  * See :ref:`Appendix: File Creation Mode <app-file-cre-mode>`.

It may have the following top level (no section) options:

``meta``
  Specify the configuration metadata for the suite. The section may be
  used by various Rose utilities, such as the config editor GUI. It can be
  used to specify the suite type.

``root-dir=LIST``
  A new line delimited list of ``PATTERN=DIR`` pairs. The ``PATTERN`` should
  be a glob-like pattern for matching a host name. The ``DIR`` should be the
  root directory to install a suite run directory. E.g.:

  .. code-block:: rose

     root-dir=hpc*=$WORKDIR
             =*=$DATADIR

  In this example, ``rose suite-run`` of a suite with name ``$NAME`` will
  create ``~/cylc-run/$NAME`` as a symbolic link to
  ``$DATADIR/cylc-run/$NAME/`` on any machine, except those with their
  hostnames matching ``hpc*``. In which case, it will create
  ``~/cylc-run/$NAME`` as a symbolic link to ``$WORKDIR/cylc-run/$NAME/``.

``root-dir{share}=LIST``
  A new line delimited list of ``PATTERN=DIR`` pairs. The ``PATTERN`` should
  be a glob-like pattern for matching a host name. The ``DIR`` should be the
  root directory where the suite's ``share/`` directory should be created.

``root-dir{share/cycle}=LIST``
  A new line delimited list of ``PATTERN=DIR`` pairs. The ``PATTERN`` should
  be a glob-like pattern for matching a host name. The ``DIR`` should be the
  root directory where the suite's ``share/cycle/`` directory should be
  created.

``root-dir{work}=LIST``
  A new line delimited list of ``PATTERN=DIR`` pairs. The ``PATTERN`` should
  be a glob-like pattern for matching a host name. The ``DIR`` should be the
  root directory where the suite's ``work/`` directory for tasks should be
  created.

``root-dir-share=LIST``
  .. warning::
     Deprecated.

  Same as ``root-dir{share}=LIST``.

``root-dir-work=LIST``
  .. warning::
     Deprecated.

  Same as ``root-dir{work}=LIST``.

.. _suite-config-suite-info:

Suite Configuration: Suite Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The suite information file ``rose-suite.info`` should contain the information
on identify and the purpose of the suite. It has no sections, only
``KEY=VALUE`` pairs. The ``owner``, ``project`` and ``title`` settings are
compulsory. Otherwise, any ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs can appear in this file. If
the name of a ``KEY`` ends with ``-list``, the value is expected to be a
space-delimited list. The following keys are known to have special meanings:

``owner``
  Specify the user ID of the owner of the suite. The owner has full commit
  access to the suite. Only the owner can delete the suite, pass the suite's
  ownership to someone else or change the access-list.

``project``
  Specify the name of the project associated with the suite.

``title``
  Specify a short title of the suite.

``access-list``
  Specify a list of users with commit access to trunk of the suite. A ``*`` in
  the list means that anyone can commit to the trunk of the suite. Setting
  this blank or omitting the setting means that nobody apart from the owner
  can commit to the trunk. Only the suite owner can change the access list.

``description``
  Specify a long description of the suite.

``sub-project``
  Specify a sub-division of ``project``, if applicable.


.. _application-configuration:

Application Configuration
-------------------------

The configuration of an application is represented by a directory. It may
contain the following:

* ``rose-app.conf``: a compulsory configuration file in the modified INI format.
  See :ref:`below <app-conf-file>` for detail. It contains the following
  information:

  * the command(s) to run.
  * the metadata type for the application.
  * the list of environment variables.
  * other configurations that can be represented in un-ordered ``key=value``
    pairs, e.g. Fortran namelists.

* ``file/`` directory: other input files, e.g.:

  * FCM configuration files (requires ordering of ``key=value`` pairs).
  * STASH files.
  * other configuration files that require more than ``section=key=value``.

  Files in this directory are copied to the working directory in run time.

  .. note::
     If there is a clash between a ``[file:*]`` section and a file under
     ``file/``, the setting in the ``[file:*]`` section takes precedence.
     E.g. Suppose we have a file ``file/hello.txt``. In the absence of
     ``[file:hello.txt]``, it will copy ``file/hello.txt`` to
     ``$PWD/hello.txt`` in run time. However, if we have a
     ``[file:hello.txt]`` section and a ``source=SOURCE`` setting, then it
     will install the file from ``SOURCE`` instead. If we have
     ``[!file:hello.txt]``, then the file will not be installed at all.

* ``bin/`` directory for e.g. scripts and executables used by the application
  at run time. If a ``bin/`` exists in the application configuration, it will 
  prepended to the ``PATH`` environment variable at run time.
* ``meta/`` directory for the metadata of the application.
* ``opt/`` directory. For detail, see
  :ref:`Optional Configuration <opt-config>`.

E.g. The application configuration directory may look like:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./bin/
      ./rose-app.conf
      ./file/file1
      ./file/file2
      ./meta/rose-meta.conf
      ./opt/rose-app-extra1.conf
      ./opt/rose-app-extra2.conf
      ...

.. _app-conf-file:

Application Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``rose-app.conf`` contains a serialised data structure that is an
unordered map (``sections=``) of unordered maps (``keys=values``). There can
also be ``keys=values`` without a section, at the top level. The sections and
keys can be:

``file-install-root``
  Root level setting. Specify the root directory to install file targets
  that are specified with a relative path.

``meta``
  Root level setting. Specify the configuration metadata for the application.
  This is ignored by the application runner, but may be used by other
  Rose utilities, such as the config editor GUI. It can be used to specify
  the application type.

``mode``
  Root level setting. Specify the name of a builtin application, instead of
  running a command specified in the ``[command]`` section.

.. TODO - See also Running
   Tasks > rose task-run > Built-in Applications Selection

``[command]``
  Specify the command(s) to run. The default key can be used to define the
  default command to run. Other keys can be used to define alternate commands,
  which can be selected at run time.

``[env]``
  Specify input environment variables to the command, in ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs.
  The usual ``$NAME`` or ``${NAME}`` syntax can be used in values to reference
  environment variables that are already defined when the application runner
  is invoked. However, it is unsafe to reference other environment variables
  defined in this section.

  .. note::
     ``UNDEF`` is a special variable that is always undefined at run time.
     Reference to it will cause a failure at run time. It can be used to
     indicate that a value must be overridden at run time.
  
  If the value of an environment variable setting begins with a tilde
  ``~``, all of the characters preceding the 1st slash ``/`` are considered a
  *tilde-prefix*. Where possible, a tilde-prefix is replaced with the home
  directory associated with the specified login name at run time.

``[etc]``
  Specify misc. settings.

  .. tip::
     Currently, only UM defs for science sections are
     thought to require this section.

``[file:NAME]``
  Specify a file/directory to be generated by the application runner at
  run time. ``NAME`` should be a path relative to the run time ``$PWD``, or
  ``STDIN``.

  * E.g. ``file:app/APP=source=LOCATION``.
  * See :ref:`Appendix: File Creation Mode <app-file-cre-mode>`.

``[namelist:NAME]``
  Specify a namelist with the group name called ``NAME``, which can be
  referred to by a ``source`` setting of a file. Each setting in a
  ``namelist:NAME`` section is a ``KEY=VALUE`` pair exactly like a normal
  Fortran namelist, but without the trailing comma.

``[namelist:NAME(SORT-INDEX)]``
  Same as ``[namelist:NAME]`` but:

  * It allows the ``source`` setting of a file to refer to all
    ``[namelist:NAME(SORT-INDEX)]`` as ``namelist:NAME(:)``, and the namelist
    groups will be sorted alphanumerically by the ``SORT-INDEX``.
  * It allows different namelist files to have namelists with the same group
    name. These will all inherit the same group configuration metadata
    (from ``[namelist:NAME]``).

``[namelist:NAME{CATEGORY}]`` or ``[namelist:NAME{CATEGORY}(SORT-INDEX)]``
  Same as ``[namelist:NAME(SORT-INDEX)]`` but:

  * An alternate way for grouping namelists. This allows the same namelist
    to have different usage and configuration metadata according to its
    category. Namelists will inherit configuration metadata from their basic
    group ``[namelist:NAME]`` as well as from their specific category
    ``[namelist:NAME{CATEGORY}]``.

``[poll]``
  Specify prerequisites to poll for before running the actual application.
  3 types of tests can be performed:

  ``all-files``
    A list of space delimited list of file paths. This test
    passes only if all file paths in the list exist.

  ``any-files``
    A list of space delimited list of file paths. This test
    passes if any file path in the list exists.

  ``test``
    A shell command. This test passes if the command returns a 0
    (zero) return code.

  Normally, the ``all-files`` and ``any-files`` tests both test for the
  existence of file paths.
  
  .. tip::
     If this is not enough, e.g. you want to test for the existence of a
     string in each file, you can specify a ``file-test`` to
     do a ``grep``. E.g.:

     .. code-block:: rose

        all-files=file1 file2
        file-test=test -e {} && grep -q 'hello' {}

     At runtime, any ``{}`` pattern in the above would be replaced with the
     name of the file. The above make sure that both ``file1`` and ``file2``
     exist and that they both contain the string ``hello``.

  The above tests will only be performed once when the application runner
  starts. If a list of ``delays`` are added, the tests will be performed a
  number of times with delays between them. If the prerequisites are still
  not met  after the number of delays, the application runner will fail with
  a time out. The list is a comma-separated list. The syntax looks like
  ``[n*][DURATION]``, where ``DURATION`` is an
  :ref:`ISO8601 duration <tutorial-iso8601-durations>` such
  as ``PT5S`` (5 seconds) or ``PT10M`` (10 minutes), and ``n`` is an optional
  number of times to repeat it. E.g.:

  .. code-block:: rose

     # Default
     delays=0

     # Poll 1 minute after the runner begins, repeat every minute 10 times
     delays=10*PT1M

     # Poll when runner begins,
     # repeat every 10 seconds 6 times,
     # repeat every minute 60 times,
     # repeat once after 1 hour
     delays=0,6*PT10S,60*PT1M,PT1H

Configuration Metadata
----------------------

See :ref:`conf-meta`.


.. _app-file-cre-mode:

Appendix: File Creation Mode
----------------------------

A ``[file:TARGET]`` section may have the following settings:

``source``
  A space delimited list of sources for generating this file. A source can
  be the path to a regular file or directory in the file system (globbing is
  also supported - e.g. using ``"\*.conf"`` to mean all ``.conf`` files), or
  it may be a URI to a resource. If a source is a URI, it may point to a
  section with a supported scheme in the current configuration, e.g. a
  ``namelist:NAME section``. Otherwise the URI must be in a supported scheme
  or be given sufficient information for the system to determine its scheme,
  e.g. via the root level ``schemes`` setting described below.

  .. tip::
     Normally, a source that does not exist would trigger an error in run
     time. However, it may be useful to have an optional source for a file
     sometimes. In which case, the syntax ``source=(SOURCE)`` can be used to
     specify an optional source. E.g. ``source=namelist:foo (namelist:bar)``
     would allow ``namelist:bar`` to be missing or ignored without an error.

``checksum``
  The expected MD5 checksum of the target. If specified, the file
  generation will fail if the actual checksum of the target does not match
  with this setting. This setting is only meaningful if ``TARGET`` is a
  regular file or a symbolic link to a regular file.

  .. note::
     An empty value for checksum tells the system to report the target
     checksum in verbose mode.

``mode``
  ``auto`` (default), ``mkdir``, ``symlink`` or ``symlink+``.

  The following is a list of all the supported usages:

  ``mode=auto,source=``
    Target is an empty file.

  ``mode=auto,source=SOURCE``
    Target is a copy of ``SOURCE``.

  ``mode=auto,source=SOURCE-LIST``
    Target is created by concatenating the contents of ``SOURCE-LIST``. The
    sources should either be all files or all directories.

  ``mode=mkdir``
    Target is a directory.

  ``mode=symlink,source=SOURCE``
    Target is created as a symlink of an FS ``SOURCE``.

    .. note::
       In this mode, ``SOURCE`` must be a single source. ``SOURCE`` does
       not have to exist when the symbolic link is created.

  ``mode=symlink+,source=SOURCE``
    Target is created as a symlink of an FS ``SOURCE``.

    .. note::
       In this mode, ``SOURCE`` must be a single source. ``SOURCE`` must
       exist when the symbolic link is created.

The root level ``schemes`` setting: While the system would attempt to
automatically detect the scheme of a source, the name of the source can
sometimes be ambiguous. E.g. A URL with a ``http`` scheme can be a path in a
version control system, or a path to a plain file. The root level ``schemes``
setting can be used to help the system to do the right thing. The general
syntax of the value of the root level ``schemes`` setting looks like:

.. code-block:: rose

   schemes=PATTERN-1=SCHEME-1
          =PATTERN-2=SCHEME-2

E.g.:

.. code-block:: rose

   schemes=hpc*:*=rsync
          =http://host/svn-repos/*=svn

   [file:foo.txt]
   source=hpc1:/path/to/foo.txt

   [file:bar.txt]
   source=http://host/svn-repos/path/to/bar.txt

In this example, a URI matching the pattern ``hpc*:*`` would use the
``rsync`` scheme to pull the source to the current host, and a URI matching
the pattern ``http://host/svn-repos/*`` would use the ``svn`` scheme. For all
other URIs, the system will try to make an intelligent guess.

.. tip::
   The system will always match a URI in the order as specified by the
   setting to avoid ambiguity.

The system has built-in support for the following schemes:

``fs``
  The file system scheme. If a URI looks like an existing path in the
  file system, this scheme will be used.

``namelist``
  The namelist scheme. Refer to ``namelist:NAME`` sections in the configuration
  file.

``svn``
  The Subversion scheme. The location is a Subversion URL or an FCM
  location keyword. A URI with these schemes ``svn``, ``svn+ssh`` and ``fcm``
  are automatically recognised.

``rsync``
  This scheme is useful for pulling a file or directory from a remote
  host using ``rsync`` via ``ssh``. A URI should have the form ``HOST:PATH``.
  
  .. note::
     If required, you can use the `User`_ setting in ``~/.ssh/config`` to
     specify the user ID for logging into ``HOST``.

The application launcher will use the following logic to determine the
root directory to install file targets with a relative path:

#. If the setting ``file-install-root=PATH`` is specified (at the root level)
   in the application configuration file, its value will be used.
#. If the environment variable ``ROSE_FILE_INSTALL_ROOT`` is specified, its
   value will be used.
#. Otherwise, the working directory of the task will be used.


Appendix: rose-ana configuration format
---------------------------------------

The ``rose-ana`` built-in application reads information about which analysis
steps it should perform from the ``rose-app.conf`` file for that task. Each
of the section names (in square brackets) which describe an analysis step
must follow a particular format:

* the name must begin with ``ana:``. This is required for ``rose-ana`` to
  recognise it as a valid section.
* the next part gives the name of the class within one of the analysis
  modules, including namespace information; for example to use the built-in
  ``FilePattern`` class from the ``grepper`` module you would provide the
  name ``grepper.FilePattern``.
* finally an expression within parentheses which may contain any string;
  this should be used to make comparisons using the same class unique, but
  can otherwise simply act as a description or note.

The content within each of these sections consists of a series of key-value
option pairs; just like other standard Rose apps. However the availability
of options for a given section is specified and controlled by the *class*
rather than the meta-data. This makes it easy to provide your own analysis
modules without requiring changes to Rose itself.

Therefore you should consult the documentation or source code of the
analysis module you wish to use for details of which options it supports.
Additionally, some special treatment is applied to all options depending
on what they contain:

* **Environment vars**: If the option contains any words prefixed by ``$``
  they will be substituted for the equivalent environment variable, if one
  is available.
* **Lists**: If the option contains newlines it will be returned as a list of
  strings automatically.
* **Argument substitution**: If the option contains one or more pairs of
  empty curved-parentheses ``{}`` the option will be returned multiple times
  with the parentheses substituted once for each argument passed to
  ``rose task-run``

The app may also define a configuration section; ``[ana:config]``, whose
key-value pairs define app-wide settings that are passed through to the
analysis classes. In the same way that the task options are dependent on
the class definition; interpretation of the ``config`` options is done by the
class(es), so their documentation or source code should be consulted for
details.
