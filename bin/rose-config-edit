# NAME
#     rose-config-edit
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose-config-edit [OPTIONS]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Launch the GTK+ GUI to edit a suite or application configuration.
#
#     If a suite contains more than 10 applications then they will only be 
#     loaded after startup, on demand.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --config=DIR; -C DIR
#        A path to either
#        1) a directory containing a suite with a file named 
#           'suite.rc' and a directory called 'app' containing 
#           subdirectories with files named 'rose-app.conf',
#           in the format specified in the Rose pages.
#        2) a directory containing a single 'application' - a file named
#           'rose-app.conf' and an optional subdirectory called 'file'
#           with other application files.
#     --load-all-apps
#        Force loading of all applications on startup.
#     --load-no-apps
#        Load applications in the suite on demand.
#     --meta-path=PATH; -M PATH
#        Prepend PATH to the search path for metadata (look here first).
#        This option can be used repeatedly to load multiple paths.
#     --new
#        Launch, ignoring any configuration.
