#           'suite.rc' and a directory called 'app' containing 
#           subdirectories with files named 'rose-app.conf',
#           in the format specified in the Rose pages.
#        2) a directory containing a single 'application' - a file named

#           with other application files.
#     --meta-path=PATH; -M PATH
