# NAME
#     rose suite-shutdown
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose suite-shutdown [OPTIONS] [--name=SUITE-NAME] [[--] EXTRA-ARGS ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Shutdown a running suite.
#
#     If `--name=SUITE-NAME` is not specified, the name will be determined by
#     locating a `rose-suite.conf` file in `$PWD` or its nearest parent
#     directories. In a normal suite, the basename of the (nearest parent)
#     directory containing the `rose-suite.conf` file is assumed to be the
#     suite name. In a project containing a rose stem suite, the basename of
#     the (nearest parent) directory containing the `rose-stem/rose-suite.conf`
#     file is assumed to be the suite name.
#
#     This wrapper also deals with the use case where a suite may be running on
#     dedicated servers at a site. The wrapper will make an attempt to detect
#     where the suite is running or last run.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --all
#         Shutdown all running suites. You will be prompted to confirm shutting
#         down each affected suite.
#     --name=SUITE-NAME
#         Specify the suite name.
#     --non-interactive, --yes, -y
#         Switch off interactive prompting (=answer yes to everything)
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
#     --verbose, -v
#         Increment verbosity.
#     -- --EXTRA-ARGS
#         See the cylc documentation, cylc shutdown for options and details on 
#         `EXTRA-ARGS`.
