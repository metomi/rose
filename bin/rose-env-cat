# NAME
#     rose env-cat
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose env-cat [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Substitute environment variables in input files and print.
#
#     If no argument is specified, read from STDIN. One FILE argument may be
#     "-", which means read from STDIN.
#
#     The command will look for $NAME or ${NAME} syntax and substitute them
#     with the value of the environment variable NAME. A backslash in front of
#     the syntax, e.g. \$NAME or \${NAME} will escape the substitution.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --unbound=STRING, --undef=STRING
#         The command will normally fail on unbound (or undefined) variables.
#         If this option is specified, the command will substitute an unbound
#         variable with the value of STRING, (which can be an empty string),
#         instead of failing.
