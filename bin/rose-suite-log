# NAME
#     rose suite-log
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     1. rose suite-log [--view]
#     2. rose suite-log --update [ITEM ...]
#        rose suite-log --update '*' # all task jobs
#     3. rose suite-log --archive CYCLE ...
#        rose suite-log --archive '*' # all cycles
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     View or update suite log.
#
#     1. Launch web browser to view suite log. If "rose bush" is not
#        configured, the command will offer to start it.
#     2. Pull back task job logs from any remote hosts for specified cycle
#        times or task names or IDs.
#     3. Archive (tar-gzip) job logs at the specified cycle time.
#
#     If `--name=SUITE-NAME` is not specified, the name will be determined by
#     locating a `rose-suite.conf` file in `$PWD` or its nearest parent
#     directories. In a normal suite, the basename of the (nearest parent)
#     directory containing the `rose-suite.conf` file is assumed to be the
#     suite name. In a project containing a rose stem suite, the basename of
#     the (nearest parent) directory containing the `rose-stem/rose-suite.conf`
#     file is assumed to be the suite name.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --archive
#         Archive (tar-gzip) job logs at specified cycle times. Implies
#         `--update`.
#     --force, -f
#         Same as `rose suite-log --update '*'`.
#     --name=SUITE-NAME, -n SUITE-NAME
#         Specify the suite name, instead of using basename of `$PWD`.
#     --prune-remote
#         If specified, remove job logs from remote hosts after pulling them to
#         suite host.
#     --tidy-remote
#         Deprecated. Use `--prune-remote` instead.
#     --update, -U
#         Update job logs for items specified in arguments.
#     --user=USER-NAME, -u USER-NAME
#         View mode only. View logs of a suite of a different user.
#     --view
#         Launch web browser to view suite log.
