# NAME
#     rosie delete
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rosie delete [OPTIONS] [--] [ID ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Delete suites.
#
#     Check the standard working copy location for a checked out suite
#     matching `ID` and remove it if there is no uncommitted change (or if
#     `--force` is specified).
#
#     Delete the suite directory structure from the HEAD of the central
#     repository matching the `ID`.
#
#     If no `ID` is specified and `$PWD` is a working copy of a suite, use the
#     `ID` of the suite in the working copy.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --force, -f
#         Remove working copies even if there are uncommitted changes.
#         Continue with the next `ID` if delete of a suite fails.
#     --local-only
#         Remove only the working copy of a suite.
#     --non-interactive, --yes, -y
#         Switch off interactive prompting (=answer yes to everything)
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
#     --verbose, -v
#         Increment verbosity.
