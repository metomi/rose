# NAME
#     rose host-select
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose host-select [OPTIONS] [GROUP/HOST ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Select a host from a set of groups or names by load or by random.
#
#     Use settings in $ROSE_HOME/etc/rose.conf and $HOME/.metomi/rose.conf to
#     determine the ranking method.
#
#     Print the selected host name.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --debug
#         Print stack trace on error.
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
#     --rank-method=METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]
#         Specify the method for ranking a list of hosts. The method can be:
#             "load" (by average load as reported by "uptime" divided by number
#                     of processors):
#                 If METHOD-ARG is specified, it must be "1", "5" or "15". The
#                 default is to use the 15 minute load.
#             "fs" (by % usage of a file system as reported by df):
#                 METHOD-ARG must be a valid file system in all the given hosts
#                 and host groups. The default is to use the "~" directory.
#             "random"
#     --threshold=[METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]:]VALUE
#         Each of this option specifies a numeric value of a threshold of which
#         the hosts must not exceed. Accepts the same METHOD and METHOD-ARG
#         (and the same defaults) as the --rank-method=METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]
#         option. (Obviously, the "random" method does not make sense in this
#         case.) A host exceeding a threshold will be excluded from the ranking
#         list.
#     --verbose, -v
#         Increment verbosity.
#
# CONFIGURATION
#     The command reads its settings from the [rose-host-select] section in
#     $ROSE_HOME/etc/rose.conf and $HOME/.metomi/rose.conf. All settings are
#     optional. Valid settings are:
#         default = GROUP/HOST ...
#             The default arguments to use for this command.
#         group{NAME} = GROUP/HOST ...
#             Declare a named group of hosts.
#         method{NAME} = METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]
#             Declare the default ranking method for a group of hosts.
#
#     Type "rose config rose-host-select" to print settings.
