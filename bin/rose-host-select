# NAME
#     rose host-select
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose host-select [OPTIONS] [GROUP/HOST ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Select a host from a set of groups or names by load, by free memory
#     or by random.
#
#     Print the selected host name.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --choice=N
#         Choose from any of the top `N` hosts.
#     --debug
#         Print stack trace on error.
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
#     --rank-method=METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]
#         Specify the method for ranking a list of hosts. The method can be:
#
#         `load`
#             Rank by average load as reported by `uptime` divided by number of
#             virtual processors.
#
#             If `METHOD-ARG` is specified, it must be `1`, `5` or `15`. The
#             default is to use the 15 minute load.
#         `fs`
#             Rank by % usage of a file system as reported by `df`.
#
#             `METHOD-ARG` must be a valid file system in all the given hosts
#             and host groups. The default is to use the `~` directory.
#         `mem`
#             Rank by largest amount of free memory. Uses `free -m` to return
#             memory in Mb
#         `random`
#             No ranking is used.
#
#     --threshold=[METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]:]VALUE
#         Each of these option specifies a numeric value of a threshold of which
#         the hosts must either not exceed or must be greater than depending on
#         the specified method . Accepts the same `METHOD` and `METHOD-ARG`
#         (and the same defaults) as the `--rank-method=METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]`
#         option. (Obviously, the `random` method does not make sense in this
#         case.) `load` and `fs` must not exceed threshold while `mem`
#         must be greater than threshold. A host not meeting a threshold
#         condition will be excluded from the ranking list.
#     --timeout=FLOAT
#         Set the timeout in seconds of SSH commands to hosts.
#     --verbose, -v
#         Increment verbosity.
#
# CONFIGURATION
#     The command reads its settings from the `[rose-host-select]` section in
#     the Rose configuration. All settings are optional. Type
#     `rose config rose-host-select` to print settings.
#
#     Valid settings are:
#
#     default = GROUP/HOST ...
#        The default arguments to use for this command.
#     group{NAME} = GROUP/HOST ...
#        Declare a named group of hosts.
#     method{NAME} = METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]
#        Declare the default ranking method for a group of hosts.
#     thresholds{NAME} = [METHOD[:METHOD-ARG]:]VALUE ...
#        Declare the default threshold(s) for a group of hosts.
#     timeout = FLOAT
#        Set the timeout in seconds of SSH commands to hosts.
#        (default=10.0)
