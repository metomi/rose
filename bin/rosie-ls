# NAME
#     rosie ls
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rosie ls [OPTIONS]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     List the local suites.
#
#     Search for locally checked out suites and print their details.
#
#     The default format includes a local working copy status field (%local)
#     in the first column.
#     A blank field means there is no related suite checked out.
#     "=" means that the suite is checked out at this branch and revision.
#     "<" means that the suite is checked out but at an older revision.
#     ">" means that the suite is checked out but at a newer revision.
#     "S" means that the suite is checked out but on a different branch.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --prefix=PREFIX
#         Display locally checked out suites from the specified suite 
#         repository.
#
#     --format=FORMAT; -f FORMAT
#         Control the output format of the results using a string
#         containing column names or properties preceded by %.
#         For example: rose suite-list --format="%idx from %owner"
#         might give: abc01 from daisy
#
#     --quiet; -q
#         Shorthand for --format="%idx".
#
#     --reverse; -r
#         Reverse sort order.
#     
#     --sort=FIELD; -s FIELD
#         Sort results by the field FIELD instead of revision.
#
#     --verbose; -v
#         Display full info for each returned suite.
