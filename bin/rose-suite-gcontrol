# NAME
#     rose suite-gcontrol
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose suite-gcontrol [OPTIONS] [--name=SUITE-NAME] [-- EXTRA-ARGS ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Launch suite engine's suite control GUI for a suite.
#
#     If --name=SUITE-NAME is not specified, the basename of $PWD is assumed to
#     be the suite name.
#
#     This wrapper is to deal with the use case where a suite may be running on
#     dedicated servers at a site. The wrapper will make an attempt to detect
#     where the suite is running or last run.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --all
#         Open a suite control GUI for each running suite.
#     --host=HOST
#         Specify a host.
#     --name=SUITE-NAME
#         Specify the suite name.
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
#     --verbose, -v
#         Increment verbosity.
