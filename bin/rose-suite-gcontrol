#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose suite-gcontrol [OPTIONS] [SUITE]
#     rose suite-gcontrol [OPTIONS] -- GCONTROL-ARGS SUITE
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Launch suite engine's suite control GUI for a suite.

#     This wrapper is to deal with the use case where a suite may be running on
#     dedicated servers at a site. The wrapper will make an attempt to detect
#     where the suite is running or last run.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --host=HOST
#         Specify a host.
#     --quiet, -q
#         Decrement verbosity.
