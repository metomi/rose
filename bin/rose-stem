# NAME
#     rose stem
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose stem [options]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Run a suitable suite with a specified set of source tree(s).
#
#     Default values of some of these settings are suite-dependent, specified
#     in the `rose-suite.conf` file.
#
# EXAMPLES
#     rose stem --group=developer
#     rose stem --source=/path/to/source --source=/other/source --group=mygroup
#     rose stem --source=foo=/path/to/source --source=bar=fcm:bar_tr@head
#
# OPTIONS
#     All options of `rose suite-run` are supported. Additional options are:
#
#     --source=SOURCE, -s SOURCE, --source=PROJECT=SOURCE, -s PROJECT=SOURCE
#         Specify a source tree to include in a rose-stem suite. The first
#         source tree must be a working copy as the location of the suite and
#         fcm-make config files are taken from it. Further source trees can be
#         added with additional `--source` arguments. The project which is 
#         associated with a given source is normally automatically determined
#         using FCM, however the project can be specified by putting the 
#         project name as the first part of this argument separated by an
#         equals sign as in the third example above.
#         Defaults to `.` if not specified.
#     --group=GROUP[,GROUP2[,...]], -g GROUP[,GROUP2[,...]]
#         Specify a group name to run. Additional groups can be specified
#         with further `--group` arguments. The suite will then convert the
#         groups into a series of tasks to run..
#     --task=TASK[,TASK2[,...]], -t TASK[,TASK2[,...]]
#         Synonym for `--group`.
#
# JINJA2 VARIABLES
#
#     Note that `<project>` refers to the FCM keyword name of the repository in
#     upper case.
#
#     HOST_SOURCE_<project>
#         The complete list of source trees for a given project. Working copies
#         in this list have their hostname prefixed, e.g. `host:/path/wc`.
#     HOST_SOURCE_<project>_BASE
#         The base of the project specified on the command line. This is
#         intended to specify the location of `fcm-make` config files. Working 
#         copies in this list have their hostname prefixed.
#     RUN_NAMES
#         A list of groups to run in the rose-stem suite.
#     SOURCE_<project>
#         The complete list of source trees for a given project. Unlike the 
#         `HOST_` variable of similar name, paths to working copies do NOT 
#         include the host name.
#     SOURCE_<project>_BASE
#         The base of the project specified on the command line. This is
#         intended to specify the location of `fcm-make` config files. Unlike 
#         the `HOST_` variable of similar name, paths to working copies do NOT
#         include the host name.
#     SOURCE_<project>_REV
#         The revision of the project specified on the command line. This
#         is intended to specify the revision of `fcm-make` config files.
