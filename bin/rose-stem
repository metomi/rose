# NAME
#     rose stem
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose stem [options]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Run a suitable suite with a specified set of source tree(s).
#
#     Default values of some of these settings are suite-dependent, specified
#     in the rose-suite.conf file.
#
# EXAMPLES
#     rose stem --group=developer
#     rose stem --source=/path/to/source --source=/other/source --group=mygroup
#
# OPTIONS
#     All options of "rose suite-run" are supported. Additional options are:
#
#     --source=SOURCE, -s SOURCE
#         Specify a source tree to include in a rose-stem suite. The first
#         source tree must be a working copy as the location of the suite and
#         fcm-make config files are taken from it. Further source trees can be
#         added with additional --source arguments.
#         Defaults to '.' if not specified.
#     --group=GROUP[,GROUP2[,...]], -g GROUP[,GROUP2[,...]]
#         Specify a group name to run. Additional groups can be specified
#         with further --group arguments. The suite will then convert the groups
#         into a series of tasks to run..
#     --task=TASK[,TASK2[,...]], -t TASK[,TASK2[,...]]
#         Synonym for --group.
#
# JINJA2 VARIABLES
#
#     Note that <project> refers to the FCM keyword name of the repository in
#     upper case.
#
#     RUN_NAMES
#         A list of groups to run in the rose-stem suite.
#     SOURCE_<project>
#         The complete list of source trees for a given project.
#     SOURCE_<project>_BASE
#         The base of the project specified on the command line. This is
#         intended to specify the location of 'fcm-make' config files.
#     SOURCE_<project>_REV
#         The revision of the project specified on the command line. This
#         is intended to specify the revision of 'fcm-make' config files.
