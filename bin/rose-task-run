# NAME
#     rose-task-run
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose task-run [OPTIONS] [--] [APP-COMMAND ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Provide an environment to run a suite task.
#
#     Normally, the suite task will select a Rose application configuration
#     that has the same name as the task. This can be overridden by the
#     --app-key=KEY option or the ROSE_TASK_APP environment variable.
#
#     If --no-auto-util and --util-key=KEY is not specified, the task name will
#     be passed to each built-in task utility to see if it is compatible with
#     the utility. If so, it will run the task using the task utility instead
#     of as a Rose application.
#
# OPTIONS
#     All options of "rose app-run" and "rose task-env" are supported.
#     Additional options are:
#     --app-key=KEY
#         Specify a named application configuration.
#     --no-auto-util
#         Do not automatically select a task utility based on the task name.
#     --path=PATTERN, -P PATTERN
#         Each of this specify a glob pattern for paths to prepend to the PATH
#         environment variable. If a relative path is given, it is relative to
#         $ROSE_SUITE_DIR. An empty value resets the default and any previous
#         --path=PATTERN settings.
#         (default="share/fcm[_-]make*/*/bin")
#     --util-key=KEY
#         Specify a named task utility.
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#     The following environment variables are used by "rose task-run":
#
#     ROSE_TASK_APP
#         Specify a named application configuration.
#     ROSE_TASK_UTIL
#         Specify a named task utility.
#
#     The following environment variables are used by the "fcm_make" and
#     "fcm_make2" built-in task utilities:
#
#     ROSE_TASK_N_JOBS
#         The number of jobs to run in parallel in `fcm make`. (default=4)
#     ROSE_TASK_OPTIONS
#         Additional options and arguments for `fcm make` or `rose app-run`.
#         (default='')
#     ROSE_TASK_PRE_SCRIPT
#         Source (. invoke) the specified script before running the main
#         command. (default='')

#     All environment variables documented in "rose task-env" are passed to the
#     application "rose task-run" runs.
