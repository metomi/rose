# NAME
#     rose-task-run
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose task-run [OPTIONS] [--] [APP-COMMAND ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Provide an environment to run a suite task.
#
#     Provides environment variables documented in "rose task-env". It is worth
#     noting that if the environment variables are already provided by "rose
#     task-env", this command will not override them.
#
#     Normally, the suite task will select a Rose application configuration
#     that has the same name as the task. This can be overridden by the
#     --app-key=KEY option or the ROSE_TASK_APP environment variable.
#
# OPTIONS
#     All options of "rose app-run" and "rose task-env" are supported.
#     Additional options are:
#     --app-key=KEY
#         Specify a named application configuration.
#     --app-mode=MODE
#         Run a builtin application identified by MODE. Disable automatic task
#         name association with a builtin application. If this option is not
#         specified, it will attempt use the task name to look for a builtin
#         application. If the task name does not match a builtin application,
#         the default MODE is to run the command.
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#     All environment variables of "rose app-run" and "rose task-env" are
#     supported.
#
#     The following environment variables are used by "rose task-run":
#
#     ROSE_TASK_APP
#         Specify a named application configuration.
#
#     All environment variables documented in "rose task-env" are passed to the
#     application "rose task-run" runs.
