# NAME
#     rose suite-log-view
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rose suite-log-view [OPTIONS] [TASK ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Generate and browse the log view of a suite.
#
#     If one or more TASK is specified, re-sync their logs if they are
#     submitted remotely.
#
#     Analyse the suite log to generate a JSON file for feeding into an HTML
#     based viewer. If --name=SUITE-NAME is not specified, the basename of $PWD
#     is assumed to be the suite name.
#
#     If the DISPLAY environment variable is defined. Launch the web browser to
#     display the log view unless --no-web-browse is specified.
#
# OPTIONS
#     --full, -f
#         Re-sync all remote task logs, regardless of the TASK arguments.
#     --log-archive-threshold=CYCLE-TIME
#         Switch on job log archiving by specifying a cycle time threshold. All
#         job logs at this cycle time or older will be archived. Implies --full.
#     --name=SUITE-NAME
#         Specify the suite name.
#     --no-web-browse
#         Do not open a web browser to display the log view.
