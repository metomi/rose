# NAME
#     rosie lookup
#
# SYNOPSIS
#     rosie lookup [OPTIONS] LOOKUP-TEXT ...
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Find suites in the suite discovery database.
#
#     Search for suites using either a query, search keyword or url and display
#     the information of the matching suites.
#
#     Unless an option is used to specify the lookup type the input is
#     interpreted by default as follows:
#     - string beginning with "http": url
#     - string not beginning with "http": search
#
#     If using a url remember to put it in quotes.
#
#     The default output format includes a local working copy status field
#     (%local) in the first column.
#     A blank field means there is no related suite checked out.
#     "=" means that the suite is checked out at this branch and revision.
#     "<" means that the suite is checked out but at an older revision.
#     ">" means that the suite is checked out but at a newer revision.
#     "S" means that the suite is checked out but on a different branch.
#     "M" means that the suite is checked out and modified.
#     "X" means that the suite is checked out but is corrupted.
#
# OPTIONS
#
#     --all-revs
#         Specify whether to search deleted suites and superceded suites.
#     --no-headers; -H
#         Do not print column headers.
#     --prefix=PREFIX
#         Specify the name of the suite repository to use.
#     --print-format=FORMAT, --format=FORMAT; -f FORMAT
#         Control the output format of the results using a string
#         containing column names or properties preceded by %.
#         For example: rosie lookup daisy --format="%idx from %owner"
#         might give: abc01 from daisy
#     --query; -Q
#         Run the lookup as a query.
#     --quiet; -q
#         Shorthand for --format="%idx".
#     --reverse; -r
#         Reverse sort order.
#     --search; -S
#         Run the lookup as a keyword search.
#     --sort=FIELD; -s FIELD
#         Sort results by the field FIELD instead of revision.
#     --url; -U
#         Use a url for the lookup.
#     --verbose; -v
#         Display full info for each returned suite.
