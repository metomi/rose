# Rose: How to Contribute

## Report Bugs

Report bugs and request enhancement by opening an issue on
[Rose issues @ Github](https://github.com/metomi/rose/issues). If reporting a
bug, add a recipe for repeating it. If requesting an enhancement,
describe the use case in detail.

## New Contributors

Please read the [CLA](#contributor-licence-agreement-and-certificate-of-origin).

Please add your name to the
[Code Contributors](#code-contributors) section of this file as part of your
first Pull Request (for each Cylc repository you contribute to).

## Contribute Code

We use [semver](https://semver.org/) to separate riskier changes (e.g. new features
& code refactors) from bugfixes to provide more stable releases for production environments.

**Enhancements** are made on the `master` branch and released in the next minor version
(e.g. 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

**Bugfixes** and minor usability enhancements are made on bugfix branches and
released as the next maintenance version (e.g. 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3). E.G. if the issue is on a `2.0` milestone, branch off of `2.0.x` to
develop your bugfix, then raise the pull request against the `2.0.x` branch. We will later merge the `2.0.x` branch into `master`.

We use [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for
generating the changelog. Changelog entries are added by running
```
towncrier create <PR-number>.<break|feat|fix>.md --content "Short description"
```
