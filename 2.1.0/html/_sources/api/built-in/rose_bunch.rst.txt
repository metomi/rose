.. _builtin.rose_bunch:

``rose_bunch``
==============

For the running of multiple command variants in parallel under a single
job, as defined by the application configuration.

Each variant of the command is run in the same working directory with
its output directed to separate ``.out`` and ``.err`` files of the form:

.. code-block:: sub

   bunch.<name>.out

Should you need separate working directories you should configure your
command to create the appropriate subdirectory for working in.

.. note::

   Under load balancing systems such as PBS or Slurm, you will need to
   set resource requests to reflect the resources required by running
   multiple commands at once e.g. if one command would require 1GB
   memory and you have configured your app to run up to four commands at
   once then you will need to request 4GB of memory.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: rose

   meta=rose_bunch
   mode=rose_bunch

   [bunch]
   command-format=echo arg1: %(arg1)s, arg2: %(arg2)s, command-instance: %(command-instances)s
   command-instances = 4
   fail-handle = abort
   incremental = True
   names = foo1 bar2 baz3 qux4
   pool-size=2

   [bunch-args]
   arg1=1 2 3 4
   arg2=foo bar baz qux


Configuration
-------------

The application is normally configured in the
:rose:conf:`rose_bunch[bunch]` and :rose:conf:`rose_bunch[bunch-args]`
sections of the :rose:file:`rose-app.conf` file, but
:rose:conf:`rose-app.conf[command]` can be used too, see below for details.

.. rose:app:: rose_bunch

   .. rose:conf:: bunch

      .. rose:conf:: command-format=FORMAT

         A Pythonic ``printf``-style format string to construct the commands
         to run. Insert placeholders ``%(argname)s`` for substitution of the
         arguments specified under :rose:conf:`[bunch-args]` to the invoked
         command. The placeholder ``%(command-instances)s`` is reserved for
         inserting an automatically generated index for the command
         invocation when using the command-instances setting. If not specified
         then the command to run is determined following the ``mode=command``
         logic, see :ref:`command-rose-app-run` for details, and arguments
         are made accessible to the command as environment variables.


      .. rose:conf:: command-instances=N

         Allows the user to specify an integer value for the number of
         instances of a command they want to run. This generates the values
         used by the ``%(command-instances)s`` value in command-format.
         If `[bunch]command-format` is not specified then the command instance
         is passed as the :envvar:`COMMAND_INSTANCES` environment variable
         instead. This is useful for cases where the only difference between
         invocations would be an index number e.g. ensemble members. Note
         indexes start at ``0``.

      .. rose:conf:: pool-size=N

         Allows the user to limit the number of concurrently running commands.
         If not specified then all command variations will be run at the same
         time.

      .. rose:conf:: fail-mode=continue|abort

         :default: continue

         Specify what action you want the job to take on the failure of a
         command that it is trying to run. If set to continue all command
         variants will be run by the job and the job will return a non-zero
         exit code upon completion e.g. if three commands are to be run and
         the second one fails, all three will be run and the job will exit
         with a return code of ``1``. Alternatively, if :rose:conf:`fail-mode`
         is set to abort then on failure of any one of the command variants
         it will stop trying to run any further variants N.B. the job will
         wait for any already running commands to finish before exiting.
         Commands that won't be run due to aborting will be reported in the
         job output with a ``[SKIP]`` prefix when running in verbose mode.
         For example in the case of three command variants with a
         :rose:conf:`pool-size` of ``1`` and :rose:conf:`fail-mode=abort`,
         if the second variant failed then the job would exit with a
         non-zero error code without having run the third variant.

      .. rose:conf:: incremental=true|false

         :default: true

         If set to ``true`` then only failed commands will be re-run on
         retrying running of the job. If any changes are made to the
         configuration being run then all variants will be re-run. Similarly,
         running the app with the ``--new`` option to
         :ref:`command-rose-task-run`
         will result in all commands being run. In verbose mode the app
         will report commands that won't be run due to previous successes
         in the job output with a ``[PASS]`` prefix.

         .. seealso::

            :ref:`rosebunch.CylcTasks`

      .. rose:conf:: names=name1 name2 ...

         Allows defining names for each of the command variants to be run,
         facilitating identification in logs. If not set then commands will
         be identified by their index. The number of entries in the names
         must be the same as the number of entries in each of the args to
         be used.

      .. rose:conf:: argument-mode=Default|zip or izip|zip_longest or izip_longest|product

         :default: Default

         .. _documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html

         If set to a value other than ``Default`` then the values for each
         bunch-arg will be manipulated:

         * ``zip`` or ``izip`` will shrink all values so all have the same
           length as the shortest bunch-arg.
         * ``zip_longest`` or ``izip_longest`` will pad out values for each
           bunch-arg with an empty string so that each bunch-arg is the same
           length as the longest one.
         * ``product`` will expand all provided bunch-args to create each
           possible combination.

         See the ``itertools`` `documentation`_ in Python for more information.
         ``zip`` and ``zip_longest`` are preferred to ``izip`` and
         ``izip_longest`` which are provided to maintain compatibility with
         older rose bunch tasks.

   .. rose:conf:: bunch-args

      This section is used to specify the various combinations of args to be
      passed to the command specified under :rose:conf:`[bunch]command-format`,
      if defined, or :rose:conf:`rose-app.conf[command]` otherwise.

      .. rose:conf:: argname=val1 val2 ...

         Allows defining named lists of argument values to pass to
         the commands being run. Multiple named sets of arguments can be
         defined. Each `argname` can be referenced  using ``%(argname)s`` in
         :rose:conf:`[bunch]command-format`, if specified, or ``${argname}``
         environment variable otherwise. The only disallowed names are
         ``command-instances`` and ``COMMAND_INSTANCES``, which are reserved
         for the auto-generated list of instances when the
         :rose:conf:`[bunch]command-instances=N` option is used.

.. _roseBunch.CylcTasks:

Incremental Mode In Cylc Tasks
------------------------------

When incremental mode is turned on, only failed commands will be re-run
if the task is run again (e.g. by manual triggering, or automatic retries).

If the task is run again as part of a new flow (e.g. ``--flow=new``),
then all commands will be re-run.
